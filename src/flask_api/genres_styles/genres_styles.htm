 <h1>List of All Genres &amp; Styles</h1>
<p>There are more than 13 million unique physical music releases in the 
Discogs Database. We categorize and connect releases in a few different 
ways at Discogs: by looking at the musicians who created them, the 
labels that produced them, the years that define them, and the formats 
you can find them recorded on. Genres and styles are another way to 
connect these releases, albeit in a more subjective way. Sometimes these
 nebulous similarities are geographic in nature; sometimes they are 
purely stylistic.</p>

<p>The genre and style definitions on Discogs are based on how releases 
are tagged by Contributors. Few releases have a categorical style, so 
they are often assigned based on subjectivity. Think about it — how hard
 is it to accurately describe a piece of music? How many arguments over 
genres have you had with your friends?</p>

<p><strong>Genres:</strong> The umbrella classification that houses 
different styles. Genres were decided by Discogs Contributors when the 
Database launched in 2000. They don’t necessarily mirror genres defined 
by other high-profile sites (for example, Billboard). The genres on 
Discogs range from hip-hop to classical to stage and screen.</p>

<p><strong>Styles:</strong> The more specific term that applies to 
different kinds of music, grouped together under genres. Discogs 
Contributors are consistently adding new styles to the Database, and you
 can too by submitting an official request. A style can be as broad as 
Ambient, as specific as New Jack Swing, or regional like Norteño.</p>

<p>Below, you’ll find an exhaustive list of all the styles in the 
Database broken up by their parent genre. We created this so 
Contributors can compare styles for new releases and as a fun way for 
you to unearth the different connections between releases. For an even 
cooler visual tool, check out our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220810095106/https://blog.discogs.com/en/regional-music-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">map of musical styles by region</a>.</p>

<p>Explore, discover, and, if you have the knowledge to share, consider adding more information to a style page’s description!</p>

 a piano based blues/jazz instrumental style. It was first recorded 
during the 1920s so should not be applied to any earlier recordings. 
There is some debate about which was the earlest boogie recording, but 
certainly Pine Top Smith was an early exponent of this style. His 1928 
recording “Pinetop’s Boogie Boogie” is generally regarded as the first 
use of the term. There was a boogie woogie “craze” during the late 1930s
 which saw the style become widely popular and many classic recordings 
were made at this time (notable performers include Albert Ammons, Pete 
Johnson and Meade “Lux” Lewis).

During the 1930s boogie woogie also started to influence other styles of
 music including big band and country, and many big band and country 
boogie instrumentals were recorded. During the 1940s the influence of 
boogie woogie extended further into rhythm &amp; blues and gospel.</span></li></a>

 blues is a genre of blues music that developed in the period after 
World War II in the state of Louisiana. It is generally divided into two
 major subgenres, with the jazz-influenced New Orleans blues based on 
the musical traditions of that city and the slower tempo swamp blues 
incorporating influences from zydeco and Cajun music from around Baton 
Rouge.[1] Major artists in the New Orleans tradition include Professor 
Longhair and Guitar Slim and for swamp blues Slim Harpo and Lightnin’ 
Slim. Both genres peaked in popularity in the 1960s and were covered by a
 number of rock artists. Interest declined in the later 1960s but there 
have been occasional revivals since the 1970s.</span></li></a>

 Impressionist
The term “Impressionist” was first coined in the mid-1870s, as a 
critically derisive term, of the light- and color-focused paintings of a
 small band of Paris-based artists, the so-called “Salon des Refusés” 
(Salon of the Refused) – among them Manet, Renoir, Degas, and especially
 Monet, whose “Impression, soleil levant” inspired the name. The 
application of the term to music, from the 1880s, was a rather 
predictable extension, though most composers to whom it was applied 
renounced its application – most famously Claude Debussy, who claimed 
that those critics who apply it to music are “imbeciles”, and that 
instead he is simply trying to do “something different.”

Their protestations notwithstanding, however, there are indeed aesthetic
 and technical corollaries between visual and musical “impressionism” 
that can be identified empirically. Most prominent is the notion of 
“color”. In music, the more conventional term is “timbre”, which is 
defined largely through orchestration, but likewise through harmonic 
usage, texture, etc. Creative exploration of musical timbre via 
orchestration certainly predates the Impressionist period, but it was 
especially this generation that opened up timbre as a first-tier 
parameter, to be exploited and pursued in its own right. In orchestral 
works such as Debussy’s La Mer or Maurice Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé, 
unusual usage or combinations of instruments, particularly at soft 
dynamic levels, are a common feature and give the works a distinctly 
“coloristic” sound, that would open up new possibilities to later 
composers. Even in works for solo piano – such as Debussy’s Preludes – 
new timbres are explored via extremes of register, as well as by unique 
and “colorful” approaches to harmony and melody. Indeed, it is in the 
realm of harmony that the Impressionist “sound” is most readily 
identified: via such techniques as parallel triads, whole-tone scales, 
blurring of tonal identity, extended or chromatic chords (9ths, 11ths, 
13ths), etc. Another corollary between music and painting can be 
discerned in their mutual fascination with certain “impressionist” 
themes or topics – such as water, reflection, reverie, etc. More 
generally, though, artists in both fields were motivated by a desire to 
break down old conventions in order to explore new methods and 
techniques; in music this meant turning away from the Romantic-Germanic 
emphasis on traditional large-scale forms, thematic unity, and 
development, in favor of smaller, individual forms and work-specific 
techniques.

Beyond the giants of the Impressionist period, Debussy and Ravel, other 
figures associated with the movement include the French composers Erik 
Satie and Paul Dukas, the Spaniard Manuel de Falla, and the American 
Charles Griffes, as well as – to some degree at least – Karol 
Szymanowski, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Frederick Delius, and Ottavino 
Resphigi. Among composers hailed as precursors or inspirations to later 
Impressionist developments include especially Modest Mussorgsky, 
Alexander Scriabin, and Gabriel Fauré, as well as Emmanuel Chabrier and 
César Franck. Further, Impressionist techniques and sonorities had 
resurgence among Jazz composers and performers such as Bix Biederbecke, 
Bill Evans, Gil Evans, and Duke Ellington. Above all, the Impressionist 
musical language, techniques, and aesthetic had a direct and profound 
influence on the revolutionary Modern period that followed.

 is a subgenre of Dark Wave music that emerged in the early to mid-1980s
 in the UK. It is characterized by a classical approach based on 
acoustic instrumentation and electronic sound simulation, often 
generated by synthesizers and samplers.

In the early 1980s, numerous Post-Punk bands showed an interest in art 
music and classical music but couldn’t achieve the necessary technical 
proficiency. At the time, Venomettes members Viginia Hewes, Anne 
Stephenson, and Martin McCarrick − who graduated from Royal College of 
Music and Guildhall School of Music and Drama − became influential 
figures of the British Post-Punk and New Wave scene and started working 
with a variety of seminal artists, including The Cure, The Glove, 
Siouxsie and the Banshees, Anne Clark, Marc Almond, This Mortal Coil, 
Virginia Astley, Peter Murphy, Sex Gang Children, Virgin Prunes, and 
Skin. The inclusion of traditional music instruments, especially 
chordophones such as violin, cello, and piano, became a standard for 
many 1980s Dark Wave productions.

Shortly afterwards, UK-based post-punk acts Dead Can Dance and In the 
Nursery abandoned conventional rock structures in favour of 
instrumentation, sound simulation, and compositional techniques 
associated with classical music and film scores, and produced a range of
 essential full-length works.</span></li></a>

 is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work 
combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical 
setting. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such
 as acting,scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The 
performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an 
orchestra or smaller musical ensemble.
Opera is part of the Western classical music tradition. It started in 
Italy at the end of the sixteenth century (with Jacopo Peri’s lost 
Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of
 Europe.</span></li></a>

of the label and a series of This Is Acid Jazz compilations led to the 
term being used to describe anything in styles similar to the label’s

dance music played by traditional bands, and sometimes by artists who 
make heavy use of sampling. Often, acid jazz songs consist largely of 
funky basslines and upbeat hip-hop breaks, with the only improvised

 the Bassline Wikipedia page] Bassline (sometimes referred to as 
bassline house, organ house, Niche or 4×4) is a type of music related to
 UK garage that originated in Sheffield in the early 2000s. 
Stylistically it comprises a four-to-the-floor rhythm normally at around
 135–142 beats per minute, a strong emphasis on bass, and a pop music 
aesthetic similar to that of its precursor 2-step garage.

In the scene’s early days the most prominent bassline club was the Niche
 nightclub in Sheffield, which became at the centre of controversy due 
to a police raid which resulted in the club’s closure in 2005. The club 
reopened in 2009, only to be closed down a year later, and then reopened
 a third time in 2017. Like grime, which was developing concurrently in 
London, bassline was associated with violence, anti-social behaviour and
 criminal activity during the time of its rise to popularity, which 
contributed to a general lack of willingness among venue owners and the 
police to accommodate bassline events.</span></li></a>

 is a production style that cross pollinates several other genres and 
styles, but it firmly lives under the Electronic genre as a production 
style that is almost exclusively used in DJ / Electronic Dance Music 
productions.  The production process involves taking sampled or edited 
material that has existing drums in it and then adding other drum 
elements to it by layering them on top of the existing drums.  These 
elements would typically be Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Crash, but could also 
include Toms and various percussion instruments.  The existing drums are
 greatly diminished by a variety of techniques that include (but are not
 limited to) EQ &amp; Filtering, while the layering process is aided by 
Side Chain Compression of the sampled / edited material keyed by the new
 Kick Drum. The end result is a very thick and full sounding production 
especially in the low end of the frequency spectrum. You would typically
 see Beatdown listed (in tandem) on releases with genres &amp; styles 
like (but not limited to) Disco, Funk, Soul, Boogie, Nudisco, House, 
Downtempo and Techno, but the production style could be used in almost 
any style or genre.


The production style of Beatdown came to the forefront in the early 
2000’s with the Detroit Beatdown Sound featured on “Detroit Beatdown 
(Volume One)” (2002) on Third Ear Recordings. While artists on the 
release such as Dwayne Jensen, Rick Wilhite &amp; Mike Clarke using the 
technique. As a production style, Beatdown had been in use for sometime 
before that release, most notably in some early House &amp; Hip-Hop.  
Some artists of note in the House style using it would be Miles Maeda, 
Johnick, Lance DeSardi, Soul Avengerz and X-Press 2.

Beatdown saw an increase in the late 2000’s with the rise of the Nu 
Disco scene and its second edit wave (the first edit wave occurred 
during the Disco era of the mid to late 70’s thru the early 80’s).  With

 Berlin School is a style of electronic music that emerged in the 
1970s.[1] An offshoot of Krautrock, Berlin School was so named because 
most of its early practitioners were based in West Berlin, Germany. It 
was shaped by artists such as Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Manuel
 Gottsching. Innovative Berlin School recordings were a precursor of 
ambient music.

The genre’s identification with space music distinguished it from the 
more percussive and rhythm-oriented Düsseldorf School, which included 
Can, Cluster, Kraftwerk, and Neu!. These latter bands have had a greater
 impact on synthpop and techno, while the Berlin School was a wellspring
 for ambient, electronica, new-age and trance.</span></li></a>

 is a primarily UK-based style that existed alongside and quickly became
 infused into hardcore rave/techno music, in turn leading to faster, 
more complex [jungle](https://www.discogs.com/style/jungle) and 
[hardcore](https://www.discogs.com/style/hardcore) music. Breakbeat is 
characterized by a prominent, syncopated 4/4 rhythm constructed from 
breakbeats—i.e., sampled drum breakdowns from 
[rock](https://www.discogs.com/genre/rock), 
[jazz](https://www.discogs.com/genre/jazz), 
[funk](https://www.discogs.com/style/funk), and 
[hip-hop](https://www.discogs.com/genre/hip+hop) music. Unlike jungle, 
breakbeat has very little variation or rearrangement of the drum 
patterns, and it is usually slower/mid-tempo, roughly 100 to 125 BPM, 
speeding up as the style evolved into jungle. The “Golden Age” of 
breakbeat was the early 1990s.

Some Discogs users apply the Breakbeat tag to any release that utilizes 
breakbeat samples, but such usage is contentious, especially for 
releases outside the 1988–1993 timeframe; the tag was originally 
intended to refer specifically to the pre-jungle/pre-hardcore music that
 was actually called breakbeat, or as a way to differentiate 
breakbeat-based techno from non-breakbeat-based.

There is no tag specifically for “beats and breaks” types of releases 
intended for DJs and music producers, nor is there a tag for other forms
 of dance music that contain funky drum breaks (aside from Breaks), 
regardless of whether it is made with samples, tape loops, drum 
machines, or played live.  Some Discogs users nevertheless use Breaks 
and Breakbeat tags on these types of records, going back as far as 1982 
for the first Jive Rhythm Trax release.

 is a primarily a mid-1990s to mid-2000s style combining elements of 
progressive house and trance, but with syncopated percussion patterns 
which are electro and/or breakbeat sample-based. Sub-styles include 
Funky Breaks, PsyBreaks, Florida Breaks, Progressive Breaks, and Nu 
Skool Breaks.

The breaks sound was very popular at raves in California, Florida, New 
York City, and the UK. It is not closely connected to the UK 
breakbeat/proto-jungle scene of the early ’90s, for which the Breakbeat 
tag is applicable.

The Breaks tag often appears in conjunction with the Acid tag.

The Breaks tag is also often used for some slower dance music styles 
based on very prominent breakbeat samples, often with a 
hip-hop/scratch-DJ influence, but generally steering clear of the 
aforementioned scenes and styles. This strain of breaks starts as early 
as 1987 with releases by Criminal Element Orchestra and Bomb The Bass, 
includes classic early ’90s releases by Depth Charge and Fatboy Slim, 
and continues to the present day.

 (also commonly referred to as “chipmusic,” “chipstyle music,” or “8-bit
 music,” despite often involving sounds characteristic of post-8-bit 
systems) is a subset of electronic music created using the primitive / 
raw sound synthesis characteristic of early generation home computer 
&amp; video game hardware. This can be achieved through modern 
musicmaking tools, through the original home computing / gaming consoles
 themselves (often making use of homebrew software and/or hardware), or a
 combination of the two.

Some platforms commonly adopted for this style of music include home 
computers such as the Commodore 64, Atari ST series, and ZX Spectrum; 
and gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega 
Genesis, the Nintendo Game Boy, and so forth.

What most of these devices have in common is that they predate the era 
of home computers &amp; gaming platforms capable of sampled audio 
playback; instead they relied on dedicated onboard soundchips for all 
audio, sound effects, and music, providing (by today’s standards) fairly
 simple realtime audio synthesis, with limited timbral range and 
polyphony generally limited to as few as three voices.

Chiptune is generally considered distinct from VGM (video game music), 
insofar as chiptune is often stylistically and conceptually removed from
 the music typical of games. Of course this line can often be blurry, 
and the two have considerable overlap.</span></li></a>

 term “deep house” has been used with (at least) two distinct meanings:

Originally, the term was roughly synonymous with “soulful house”. Deep 
house, in this sense, is house music influenced by jazz, soul, and 
gospel. Vocals (both male and female) are common, and lyrical themes 
include positivity, community, love, self-belief, and overcoming 
hardship. Overly synthetic sounds are downplayed, in favor of pianos, 
organs, horns, bass guitar, etc. Tracks sometimes follow more of a 
conventional verse-chorus-verse structure than other forms of house.

In the 2010s, “deep house” has been applied to a newer style of house 
that tends toward the dreamy, laid-back, subdued, atmospheric, 
reflective, and minimalistic. (This sense of the term is roughly 
synonymous with “lo-fi house”.)</span></li></a>

 (or downbeat) music is associated with a variety of different Discogs 
genres including electronic, jazz, rock, and some world music. It is 
generally 50 to 90 BPM, and sometimes there is not even any overt

The Downtempo tag was originally intended to refer to 1990s–2000s 
chillout or lounge music that has a slow, rolling, hip-hop or 
dub-inspired groove with sampled beats, and which can be broadly 
categorized as primarily jazzy, primarily dubby, or both. However, as 
downtempo is loosely defined, it has become an umbrella term for a broad
 selection of music with moody tones, chilling to passionate vocals, 
crossover indie vibes, and mellow beats.

Usage of the Downtempo tag for music from before c. 1989 or as a generic
 tempo descriptor is likely to be contentious.</span></li></a>

 style characterized by the use of sustained sounds and notes. 
Originally, a drone is a low-pitched sound supporting the main patterns 
of the musical piece, most typically in bagpipes.

In its purest form, a drone music piece will consist of a few notes 
continued for several tens of minutes with only very slow distortions 
(for instance, The Hafler Trio’s Trilogy, Cleave, No Man Put Asunder and
 No More Twain, Of One Flesh).

Drones are also used in Doom Metal, where the bass line remains 
unchanged for several minutes while sometimes lacking any tempo (for 
instance, Earth and Sunn O)))).

Drones also feature in Noise and other experimental recordings, where 
the hypnotic and sometimes jarring effects of sustained notes are 
applied to the listener for an extended period of time (for instance, 
Nackt Insecten’s Sick Animal Eyes, Time Machines’ self-titled album, and
 Keiji Haino and Sitaar Tah!’s collaborative album, Animamima.)</span></li></a>

developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae. The style consists 
predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is 
achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings, 
usually through the removal of vocals, emphasis of the rhythm section 
(the stripped-down drum-and-bass track), the application of studio 
effects such as echo and reverb, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or 
instrumental snippets from the original version or other works. It was

 is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London, 
England, that generally features syncopated drum and percussion patterns
 with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies. The tempo 
is usually around 140 BPM and the snare will hit down on the third beat,
 this makes dubstep easily mixed with 70 or 140 BPM tunes.

It emerged in the late 1990s as a development within a lineage of 
related styles such as 2-step garage, broken beat, drum and bass, 
jungle, dub and reggae. According to urban legend, the term dubstep was 
coined in 2002 by [Ammunition 
Promotions](http://www.discogs.com/label/309132-Ammunition-Promotions-Ltd)
 in a press release sent to [XLR8R magazine](https://www.xlr8r.com/). In
 the UK the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the
 Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s. </span></li></a>

 synth (also known as fantasy music) is an Ambient genre that emerged in
 the early 1990s, stylistically related to orchestral Soundtracks, 
particularly Film Score music. Where the purpose of a film score is to 
set the mood accompanying visual scenery, dungeon synth can be 
considered a similar concept using sound only, making it a ‘score 
without a film’. In this sense, the genre is a highly narrative form of 
music, with “scenes” that are played out in almost theatrical fashion. 
Synthesizers and keyboards are the primary instruments of choice, with 
vocals, samples and acoustic instruments also frequently used. Pioneered
 by artists such as Mortiis, Burzum and Pazuzu, the intention of dungeon
 synth is generally to evoke settings of fantasy and adventure, drawing 
inspiration from European mythology, fantasy writers such as J.R.R. 
Tolkien, fairy tales, as well as role-playing games like Dungeons and 
Dragons. Dark Ambient music, Western Classical Music and Darkwave are 
often cited as influences for the mood and atmosphere of dungeon synth. 
The style is also used in the soundtracks of some Video Game Music with 
medieval or dungeon-based settings, often being blended with Bit Music.</span></li></a>

 body music (EBM) is a genre of electronic music that combines elements

to prominence in Belgium at the end of the decade. EBM was generally 
considered a part of the European new wave and post-punk movement and 
the first style that blended synthesized sounds with an ecstatic style 
of dancing (e.g. pogo).

In the second half of the 1980s, a youth-cultural scene emerged from EBM
 whose followers describe themselves as EBM-heads or (in North America)

 style that began as an early form of hip-hop, Electro has grown to 
encompass anything that uses the classic, electronic, syncopated beat 
found on tracks like “Planet Rock” by Afrika Bambaataa or “White Lines” 
by Grandmaster Flash &amp; The Furious Five, or as popularized by Herbie
 Hancock’s “RockIt”. Electro is also applied retroactively to some of 
the music of Kraftwerk, particularly “Numbers” and “Home 
Computer”—forward-looking, danceable electronic tracks which were highly
 regarded in early hip-hop culture.

Aside from the distinctive rhythm pattern, Electro is often 
distinguished by an emphasis on synthesizers, vocoders, and dry, 
syncopated/”funky” drum sounds (as opposed to the monotonous, low-pitch 
bass drum of house and techno). In contrast to typical hip-hop approach 
of mining funky beats and warm basslines from old vinyl and emphasizing a
 rap vocal, the Electro vibe is more about producing new, cold, heavily 
synthetic-sounding beats and minimal basslines, with chanted vocals, 
extended instrumental passages, and minor-key lead synth themes.

The funky side of Electro can include sung vocals, is also known as 
Electro-Funk, and was a basis of the freestyle genre (initially “Latin 
hip-hop”). The Techno side of Electro is rooted in the music of Cybotron
 and Model 500, and was defined more fully in the ’90s by artists such 
as Drexciya and Anthony Rother. The term or prefix Electro is also 
applied to synth-pop and industrial dance music with little or no 
hip-hop connection, but which just incorporated similarly styled beat 
patterns, instrumentation, and overall feel.

In recent years, club and mainstream dance music has been infiltrated by
 a more modern and rock-influenced sound, now known as “Electro-House” 
and sometimes just referred to as Electro. This sound usually features a
 loud, four to the floor kickdrum with melodies and basslines 
remeniscent of 80’s synth-pop. As with Electroclash and in contrast with
 pure Electro, Electro-House is often dominated by lead synths or 
samples which use distortion as a characteristic effect; examples 
include some of the music of Justice or Kavinsky.

On Discogs, Electro is a style tag in both the Electronic and Hip Hop 
genres. If in doubt which genre applies, ask in the Database Forum.

During one of the major updates of the Discogs back end, Electronic 
genre releases with no style tag were given the tag Electro 
automatically. This resulted in many releases being tagged as Electro in
 error.</span></li></a>

 in nightclubs during the 1990s, particularly in Europe. Very formulaic,
 Eurodance makes heavy use of synthesizers: strong basslines, pounding 
beats, with a set tempo anywhere between 90 and 160 beats per minute, 
but usually in the 120-150 range. A typical song will have male rappers 
sing the verses and female singers perform the chorus, but variations 
are not rare.

Eurodance was at its peak from 1993 to the early 2000s, with acts such 
as Snap!, Technotronic, Corona, Masterboy, Cappella, DJ BoBo, Real McCoy
 and Culture Beat being amongst the most popular names.

The style was born out of cross-influence between various styles, 
including Hip Hop, House, Techno, Hi-NRG, Euro Disco and Italo Disco. A 
bulk of the production of the era was made in Italy and Germany. 
Entering the 2000s, the style changed drastically and branched out to be
 associated with new subgenres, including Italodance and Hands Up, while
 sometimes still being called Eurodance.

Eurodance is sometimes confused with the related Euro House, which in 
fact draws influences from Dance-pop, rather than Techno and Hi-NRG.</span></li></a>

 music consciously deviates from established musical norms (of a 
particular genre, or of music in general). Music of almost any genre can
 be considered experimental – but the term is most associated with the 
more abstract and challenging strains of electronic music, jazz, and the
 modernist avant-garde of the mid-20th century.

Experimental music might explore new compositional techniques (e.g., 
John Cage’s use of the I Ching, or Steve Reich’s process music), new 
musical forms (e.g., drone music or free improvisation), unusual 
instruments (e.g., the theremin, or Harry Partch’s homemade 
instruments), extramusical sounds (e.g., musique concrète or Matmos), 
“extended technique” (playing instruments in unusual ways – e.g., Cage’s
 prepared piano), microtonal scales, minimalism (e.g., lowercase music),
 unexpected stylistic fusions, abrasive timbres and rhythms, or any 
other aspect of music.

As such, “experimental music” isn’t really a single style with a 
distinct sound. It’s more of a sensibility: an effort to explore new 
musical frontiers, and to expand the boundaries of musical experience.

 / Hardfunk is a fast &amp; pumpin dance music genre originated from 
Indonesia and begin to grow audience there in the early 2000s. It’s key 
signatures are funky drum pattern, pumpin bassline, atmospheric synths 
&amp; heavy use of voice samples. Other common characteristic is the 
groove flow that feels quite similar to locally-popular dangdut music, 
also originated from Indonesia.

Funkot/Hardfunk was born initially as an experiment by some Indonesia’s 
early generation DJs/Producers such as Jockie Saputra, Krazy Sandy &amp;
 Tommy Fans. Jockie Saputra exhibited some early funkot form with his 
creative live-mixing and loop sampling skills which in one example he 
performed with live-remix of “Kolam Susu” in mid 1990’s. Later he will 
remix many popular dub ,soulfull &amp; classic house music either live 
or digitally to became sounded more “funky” or “urban”. Tommy Fans &amp;
 Krazy Sandy mostly well known for several original tracks with unique 
beat model (later become one of funkot’s basic beat model) such as 
“Lenong Groove” &amp; “Soon Da”. Tommy Fans particularly was the most 
advanced thinking and professional equiped music creator in Indonesia at
 that time. Many yet-to-become future producers looked up to these early
 legends as their inspirations and also tutors.

With the arrival of hard house and hard trance to Indonesia in the late 
1990’s, fast &amp; powerful dance music became increasingly more popular
 than conventional house music. In this particular period few creative 
producers such as C2 frequently modified several parts of a popular club
 song (chorus part for example) by replacing the usual 4/4 kick pattern 
with funky drum pattern &amp; also sometimes modified the bassline to 
dangdut style bass. These remix method proved to be very well received 
by most Indonesian partygoers at the time due to its culturally familiar
 sound result. This modification extended over time from partial to 
eventually entire song utilizised various sampled materials from many 
classic hits such as percussion loop, instrumentals and voice phrases 
makes it a new unique bootleg genre. While some DJs still mention this 
kind of music as “House Music” or “Funky House”, most Indonesians 
acknowledged this genre as “Funky Kota” or simply “Funkot” due to its 
origin of popularity (and producers) at “Kota” district in Jakarta, the 
city’s dance music &amp; nightlife central area. However nowadays 
alternative names are also used such as “Hardfunk” or “Funkcore” which 
eliminates “Kota” word thus give it more relation with the actual 
content rather than geographic refference.

Because general club tracks in early 2000s have a universal tempo range 
(around 140BPM – 160BPM) means almost every song existed technically 
could be remixed to a club track. And because funkot in particular was 
not bound with any existing genre’s characteristics meaning it was a 
more versatile and interesting new option for a remix. Many amateur 
&amp; already existed producers applied funkot remix to various pop hits
 at the time &amp; also reworked classic dance hits which met by 
overwhelmingly positive response from the crowd. The tempo itself 
continued to increase every year (influenced mostly from the booming 
&amp; popularity of ecstassy which makes the user always wanted to go 
faster and harder) until in recent state reach 180BPM as its basic tempo
 and sometimes featured a 130BPM downtempo section if the remix material
 couldn’t fit perfectly in 180BPM. Although most early funkot production
 quality were deemed pretty bad by today standards (both technical and 
creative aspects) that didn’t stop the trend to keep continue gained 
mass popularity in Indonesia until around year 2010.

The genre itself keep changing forms and adapt many new music trends 
from all over the world, with its leading pioneer Jockie Saputra became 
its first main developer with his iconic pumping percussion sound and 
fat bassline style. Other brainchilds of the genre include some of the 
most creative minds in Indonesian funkot scene such as DJ Abaz, DJ Andi,
 DJ Ronny, DJ Roy B, DJ Apin, DJ Nicko, DJ Dealy and many more (later 
including their proteges) helped to develop the genre in their 
respectively distinct style and signatures. In their hands the genre 
reached its peak popularity and creative performance. Unfortunately 
until then this genre had not yet recognized outside Indonesia mainly 
due to poor management and lack of proper promotion skills of the 
producers. In most cases many independent individuals self-published 
their own tracks or remixes, even the ones officially published by 
record label were not distributed or promoted very well. Resulting in 
degrading production quality and image.

Lately due to the extensive efforts of well designed promotion and 
constructive interactions between some Indonesian Funkot pioneers and 
other producers worldwide the genre already started to recognized by 
several small community groups in related countries such as Japan, 
India, US, Myanmar etc, and so far it generally received positive 
responses. Ironically while it seems to start blossom in some countries 
it actually begin to lost significant popularity in its own birthplace 
Indonesia. The main cause beside introduction of new fresh genre is 
funkot considered dated right now by most Indonesians after aired for 
more than 10 years whilst in other countries it is still a fresh and 
exciting new stuff. Some producers from other countries are even already
 active producing their own version of Funkot.

The light may already started to dim at home but the story is just about
 to begin in other places. For those creative minds everywhere the limit
 of what this genre can do is endless. As for the ones who from the very
 beginning dedicated their career for decades to developing and bring 
this genre till this point, it sure will always has a special place in 
their hearts.</span></li></a>

 of hardcore born in Rotterdam (the Netherlands) in the early 90s as a 
counter-reaction towards the house scene of Amsterdam with its luxurious
 clubs and snobby clubgoers. Sometimes the music and its culture are 
linked to soccer hooliganism and the extreme right movement, and not 
completely without a reason, for these subcultures do possess similar 
characteristic elements. Also known and referred to as gabba, hardcore 
or gabberhouse. “Gabber” (Dutch) translates to “mate” and a similar word
 can be found on many Germanic languages.

The most prominent and distinctive feature of gabber is a repetitive 4×4
 kick drum that is usually created by a drum machine (such as Roland 
TR-909) or by sampling and which is then distorted/edited to bring a 
gabber song the distinguishable melodic bass tone. With such a bass 
drum, an additional or a separate bassline is seldom used. Drum fills 
occur oftentimes at the middle/end of each pattern.

Almost as important to a gabber song is the wet-reverberated clap 
accompanied with a snare drum and open hi-hat. These aforementioned 
sounds can be played in between the kick drums, as well. Also vocal 
samples from rap and contemporary pop music &amp; movies, musical loops 
from other subgenres of electronical dance music such as techno and 
trance, guitar riffs from rock/heavy music and drum loops &amp; 
breakbeats are used. As drum n bass –  breaking through from the UK – 
gained popularity worldwide, especially in the Netherlands this was 
reflected as a heavy use of the so-called “Amen break” in gabber 
productions around ’95. It is common in gabber music to play the (vocal)
 samples, synths and drum loops on two different octaves. All these 
things contribute to the drive, dynamics and the hefty, bouncing rhythm 
of this style.

Alongside the Netherlands, gabber was and is still mostly produced and 
released in Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, Italy and USA. The 
BPM-range varies from 130 to 230. In the heyday of gabber music 
(1993–1998) the leading trend was a tempo of 170–190 BPM. Towards the 
end of the 90s gabber of the newstyle/new school started to emerge with 
sounds and aesthetics leaning more towards the world of doomcore, 
hardcore techno and hard house instead of the traditional inspiration 
and influence from hard trance, (happy) hardcore and jungle/drum n bass.
 The Dutch sound turned into something much darker, sinister and less 
melodic. German gabber, on the other hand, had always been from the 
darker and less happy side. The mid-90s German sound was also notably 
faster compared to the rest of the Europe’s, bringing its ties closer to
 the birth of speedcore along with certain American artists.

Summa summarum — gabber is the outcome from the fusion of the 
undergournd rave culture in Europe: the Dutch techno, the faster Belgian
 beats, the hardcore sound of Germany, and the whole unbridled acid 
house legacy from the United States, infused all together with massive 
sampling from the world of the contemporary pop culture and 
tongue-in-cheek usage of profanities à la rap acappellas that give this 
genre its wonderfully whacky signature imprint not far way from the 
realm of novelty music, in terms of certain sincerity and off-the-wall 
innovativity.

 term Goa Trance was first used in 1994 and changed in 1996 for Psy 
Trance. In the beginning the terms Goa and Psychedelic became 
intermingled, with the full term being Psychedelic Goa Trance, later as 
the sound progressed after 1998-1999 the term Goa was used only in 
reference of the old pre1999 sound and releases. According to Goa legend
 DJ Chicago in an interview in mushroom magazine “… it started being 
known as both Goa Trance and Psychedelic Trance somewhere in the mid 
90s. As i remember they were interchangeable”. Psychedelic Trance along 
with its sub genres was what inherited the continuity of the Goa term. 
The first specific labels were Dragonfly Records that edited in August 
93 the compilation Project II Trance &amp; Underground 
French-Kommunication. Then a lot of “Goa” labels were founded in London :
 TIP , Platipus, Matsuri, Flying Rhino, Blue Room Released, Bomm 
Records, CelticRecords, Sirius Records, Phantasm &amp; Symbiosis 
Records. This explosion of labels in London was possible after Paul 
Oakenfold gave to the Goa sound legitimacy on « The Essential Mix », a 
popular Radio show on BBC Radio 1. Meanwhile in Germany, Goa artists 
were diffused via classical Trance labels like Gaia Tonträger, Tunnel 
Records, Polytox Records, Spirit Zone Recordings and Eye Q Records and 
the style became also very popular in Israel with groups like Astral 
Projection or Infected Mushroom. Lots of Goa Trance fans consider the 
12″ “Etnica Tribute” as a milestone of the style. In 1998 the scene got 
another direction more dark &amp; repetitive like Techno. So this style 
of “Goa Trance” is in fact the Psy Trance.

   Goa Trance is played in tempo around 130-150 bpm . This kind of 
Trance is hypnotic, with pulsing melodies, floating
   basslines and use a lot of Mid-Asiatic musical phrasing. A popular 
element of Goa trance is the use of samples, often from science fiction 
movies &amp; all that refeer to esoterism. Most of the technology used 
was popular analogue synthesizers. Another caracteristic from the style 
is that the Djs used DAT players to execute theirs sets, because they’re
 more practical to travel and less sensitive to the beach sand. While 
the DAT didn’t have a pitch control system the mix between the songs was
 very short and not necessary in the tempo. Another “Goa” tradition is 
to make a blank between the sets so the dj’s can estimate their 
popularity by the dancers applause level.</span></li></a>

 is a genre of electronic dance music that emerged in London in the 
early 2000s. It developed out of earlier UK electronic music styles, 
including UK garage and jungle, and draws influence from dancehall,

breakbeats, generally around 140 bpm, and often features an aggressive

 style, and lyrics often revolve around gritty depictions of urban life.

The style initially spread among pirate radio stations (such as Rinse

 hardcore is a genre of electronic music originally developed in the 
United Kingdom and The Netherlands. It is present mainly in the UK, 
Europe, the North American continent and Australia. In the UK, the genre
 emerges in the early 1990s and is originally characterized by breakbeat
 sound samples and variants of other musical styles such as hip hop and 
italohouse. Subsequently in 1996 the genre divided into two distinct 
sub-genres, the first focusing on the breakbeat and the second 
containing the codes of hardcore techno, characterized by a line of 
semi-distorted kicks 4/4.

In 1995, the first happy hardcore singles such as I Wanna Be A Hippy and
 Wonderful Days, and Dutch groups Technohead and Charly Lownoise &amp; 
Mental Theo, respectively, enter the national music charts and give a 
first timid media popularity to the genre. In 1997, happy hardcore 
reaches its peak of popularity in mainly British and Dutch markets 
through the growth in sales of music compilations like Bonkers UK, the 
Dutch Thunderdome and Happy 2b Hardcore in Canada, as well as the fact 
that many singles of the genre appear in international music charts. 
However, in 1998, the genre begins to decline sharply and much of the 
public believes it to be ‘dead’. In the early 2000s however, it revives 
partially in the form of a new related genus reworked named UK hardcore,
 mainly directed towards the euphoric trance.</span></li></a>

lashes, Rachel Auburn and Lisa Pin-Up. Subsequentially Hard House record
 labels were formed such as Tidy Trax, Nukleuz, Jump Wax Records, and

*Confusingly the term Hard House is sometimes used in reference to the 
House tracks that were being released in the US prior to the term being 
adopted in the UK. Typically a ‘harder’ sounding House style coming out

 the end of the 1990s, fueled by the Schranz movement, a new, extremely 
hard style of Techno became popular, which is now generally referred to 
as Hardtechno. This style runs at very high bpm, usually 150 or more and
 features heavy distortion and prominent kickdrum.

Not to get confused with Dark Techno. Many affluent mainstream Techno 
listeners often regard the darker variant of it as being called Hard 
Techno. It should not be confused with the new-coming Industrial/Early 
Techno sound produced by artists like I Hate Models or AIROD which often
 goes around 135-140 BPM. The BPM often makes a great difference and 
Hard Techno oscillates around 150 BPM or higher—as mentioned above. </span></li></a>

 Trance falls into two distinct periods, but both have their birthplace 
in Germany. The original style (which became popular around 1993-94), 
was typified by a fast (+150bpm) tempo along with strong acid lines and 
prominent melodies. Popular acts around this time were Sunbeam, Komakino
 and Jeyênne.

This progressed up until the late 90’s, when a new style of Hard Trance 
emerged thanks to the likes of DJ Scot Project &amp; Kai Tracid. This 
new style brought the tempo down into the 140bpm range, and focused more
 on Euphoric Trance in construction. The kick drums &amp; basslines were
 exaggerated, bringing an aggressiveness which separated the style from 
standard Trance. Also, producers such as DJ Scot Project pioneered 
extended breakdown / buildups, hightening the tension.

It ceased being popular in the mid-2000’s.</span></li></a>

 can refer to 1a) electronic dance music style “hardcore” that is 
usually quite fast and always rather hard (hence the name), 4×4-beat 
form of techno. Originated and popular in Germany, Belgium and Holland. 
Also favoured and prominent since the early days in UK and US. Developed
 from the sounds of acid, techno, house and hardcore breakbeat of which 
more later. In Belgium the style of new beat should be mentioned as 
precedent to techno. Later faster variation of techno was being produced
 in Belgium which eventually led to hardcore and gabber over there.

Hardcore can be fairly minimal and refined consisting of synthetic pad 
sounds, a (Roland TB-303) acid line, drum pattern (Roland TR-909 or 
TR-808, for example) and sampled vocal sounds. The beat from the drum 
machine is similar to any other harder variety of electronica: open and 
closed hi-hats, snare, clap, ride cymbal and cymbal at the beginning of a
 pattern and on the fills at the end. Usually used in a way that gives 
the style its distinctive frenzy and hardness, and making the hectic 
beat sound even faster than it actually is. All the drum sounds can be 
also heavily reverberated, echoed, flangered or being filtered up and 
down on the breakdowns or throughout the entire song. Distortion is 
extremely often used especially on the kick drum making it a highly 
distinguishable feature of the style.

Hardcore has also another side besides the more sophisticated one with 
tweaking acid lines and drum machine-made beats: and equally hard but 
more brutal and not-so-subtle, based more on sampling of sounds and 
voices, synths and hoovers and breakbeats/drum loops. With the clap and 
snare beating each time – or on 2 &amp; 4 – on the 4×4 beat, this 
variation of hardcore is closely related to gabber which is the most 
similar style within the electronic genre. Compared to gabber, hardcore 
tends to be a bit slower but the tracks are executed in a more complex 
way sound- and structurewise. It’s more sinister, whereas gabber can be 
described often quite silly, joyous and tongue-in-cheek and leaning on 
(melodic) rhythm patterns, although humour is not completely unknown to 
hardcore either. The BPM-count may be lower but the overall atmosphere 
of a song is darker and harder-edge. Hard techno and industrial hardcore
 are two other styles akin.

The kick drum can be hard, sharp and technolike or harsh, distorted and 
raw. It can be echoed or reverbed to give it a full, pumping character 
that moves the track forward. The distortion can also be used in the 
same manner as in jumpstyle, gabber, hard trance or US hard house: 
making the bass drum low and booming but not turning the waveform jaded 
or jagged; maintaining certain roundness and softness to it. The tempo 
is within 130–235 BPM. German Marc Trauner (Acardipane) released the 
first song considered hardcore in 1990: Mescalinum United – We Have 
Arrived.

or

1b) Hardcore breakbeat – a style of electronic dance music with a 
broken, mostly sampled beat structure. Emerged in the UK in the early 
90s. Lots of pitched-up rap vocal samples and drumloops, hoovers, stabs,
 pianos and chords used. Heavy on bass; sub-bass sounds used. 
Predecessor of jungle and drum &amp; bass. BPM: 120–150.

or

2) Rock style – also known as hardcore punk – that was started in the 
late 70s by Middle Class, followed by Black Flag and then by the likes 
of Discharge (from Stoke-on-Trent), Circle Jerks, Minor Threat, Asocial,
 Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Bad Brains, The Germs and many, many more. 
While early hardcore punk was extremely tied to punk rock, the genre 
developed into a more aggressive and of shorter songs. The term 
“hardcore punk” was probably coined by Discharge (from Middlesborough, 
not the D-beat band from Stoke-on-Trent) in their 1980 split EP with The
 Filth, in their song “Hardcore Punx”. Canadian Band D.O.A.’s Seminal 
1981 12″ “HARDCORE ’81” also forwarded the term to general use. The 
expression “mosh” (as in “moshing” or “mosh pit”) is attributed to H.R. –
 reggae/hardcore punk band Bad Brains vocalist and frontman – who used 
the word “mash” (pronounced “mosh” in a Jamaican accent) lyrically and 
on-stage, in the means of inciting and to describing the aggressive and 
often violent dancing that took place in concerts.</span></li></a>

drum, intense faded or reversed basslines accompanying the beat, a

 the name implies, Hi-NRG is a higher-BPM style of dance music that was 
very popular in the 1980s, especially in gay nightclubs. It evolved from
 disco, preserving the four-on-the-floor kick drum and emphasizing 
strong melodies and simple octave bass lines, but also having a harder, 
more rock-like sound, with pop vocals and snare hits on the 2s and 4s. 
In addition to the main beat, there was usually an accompanying second, a
 syncopated “shuffle” rhythm, often made with a tambourine or similar 
high-pitched snare sound (or, more often, an electronic variant 
thereof).

The early Hi-NRG repertoire was dominated by the dense, synth 
bass-driven sound of American producers Patrick Cowley and Bobby 
Orlando, and then the tighter, rapid-fire syncopated percussion of UK 
producers Ian Anthony Stephens and Ian Levine. The later Hi-NRG sound 
was defined largely by the PWL Hit Factory—producer/songwriters 
Stock/Aitken/Waterman and engineers Phil Harding &amp; Ian 
Curnow—starting with Dead or Alive’s “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)”
 in 1984 and continuing through a string of dance-pop hits in the late 
’80s.

In the first half of the ’80s, Hi-NRG enjoyed mainstream success as 
aerobics/workout music. The style’s peak in 1986–1988 led to wider 
acceptance, with songs like “Boom Boom (Let’s Go Back to My Room)” by 
Paul Lekakis and “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley enjoying long 
chart runs and much radio play. This coincided with an increasing 
influence of house music, like the use of longer, more repetitive bass 
lines and open hi-hat sounds on the off beat. The peak was followed by a
 very rapid decline as house music and Eurodance overtook the club scene
 in 1989.</span></li></a>

 hop music, also called hip-hop, rap music, or hip-hop music, is a music
 genre consisting of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies
 rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as
 part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic 
elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching, break dancing, and graffiti 
writing. Other elements include sampling (or synthesis), and beatboxing.
 While often used to refer to rapping, “hip hop” more properly denotes 
the practice of the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is 
sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is 
not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also 
incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing and 
scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.

The actual hip-house scene was almost exclusively a Chicago phenomenon 
which started (on wax) in 1988 and had run its course by the end of 
1990. It was created by house music producers, and featured a fast, 
syncopated rapping flow. This was in contrast to what pioneering 
hip-house producer Fast Eddie called “house rap”, in which hip-hop 
artists from other regions combined more traditional, slower rapping 
styles with house, or the European house- and techno-based club music 
which incorporated rapping as a “hard”/”streetwise” novelty.

On Discogs, the Hip-House tag tends to be applied to any combination of 
rap vocals with house music, thus it includes all of these variations

 music is a genre of experimental music that emerged in the mid-1970s. 
Its basic components are semi-acoustic and include the use of electronic
 instruments as well as unusual objects such as metal rods and pipes, 
and rigged power tools. It incorporates noise, tape manipulation, 
drones, metallic timbres, monotonous rhythms evocative of machinery, and
 similar “factory floor” aesthetics. Traditional instruments are 
sometimes used, but usually in non-traditional ways. Vocals, if present,
 tend to be either disaffected or angry. Lyrical content tends to embody
 dark themes, as well as protest, tension, uncertainty, and the like. As
 with many alternative styles, it generally eschews pop melodies, 
virtuosic solos, and romantic themes.

Industrial has always had a fragmented identity, not having anywhere 
near as cohesive a sound as most other electronic genres, and it has 
long had a love/hate relationship with dance music. In its early years 
(mid-1970s to mid 1980s), industrial music was partly rhythmic but 
rarely danceclub-friendly, and was predominantly a product of the heady 
British, Australian, and European art-school scenes.

After the split of Throbbing Gristle in 1981, Industrial music spawned 
several subgenres that have been described as Post-industrial music. 
This includes genres such as Power Electronics (Whitehouse), Ambient 
Industrial or Dark Ambient (Lustmørd), Martial Industrial (Laibach), 
Ritual music (Zero Kama), and Electronic body music, a genre that 
combines Industrial elements with early Electro-punk (DAF). Many of 
these styles have their own entry on Discogs.

In the mid and especially latter half of the 1980s, bands from the New 
Wave/SynthPop scene such as Ministry adopted elements of Post-industrial
 music (e.g. EBM) and Rock music and laid the foundations of Industrial 
rock.

             Italo House is a form of ‘House music’ that originated in 
Italy. It was mainly popular in Italy, the U.K., and the United States 
in the late 80’s to early 90’s and has since become more popular all 
over the world. This style of music originally blended House music with 
the Italo Disco sound, hence the name ‘Italo House’. The main 
characteristic of this musical genre originally was the use of samples, 
especially female vocal samples over a House groove that was 
predominantly ruled on some tracks by electronic piano chords. Taking 
influences from the early Chicago House hits of the late 80s.

           Typically the vocals used in most Italo House tracks where 
sampled from early U.S. Freestyle and House tracks, such as ‘Listen Up –
 Listen Up’, ‘Darcy Alonso – Waited so long’, ‘Kristol – Passion of a 
woman’ &amp; ‘India – Dancing on the fire’ etc. The music also featured 
male &amp; female raps, or sections of raps which were lifted from Hip 
Hop or Hip House acapella’s from around the same time. They also sampled
 the big vocals from Disco Diva’s such as Aretha Franklin, Jocelyn 
Brown, Loleatta Holloway, Patti La Belle and Seidah Garrett.

           Samples came from various acapellas from tracks such as:- 
Aretha Franklin – Rokk-A-Lott / Jocelyn Brown – I’m Gonna Get You Boy / 
Loleatta Holloway – Love Sensation. These powerful vocals would usually 
be used for the chorus, sometimes even not making much sense, due to the
 Italian musicians and producers at the time not understanding English 
very well. A prime example is the use of Loleatta Holloways ‘Right on 
time’ vocal, used in the 1989 No.1 hit by Black Box called ‘Ride On 
Time’.

            In most cases the Italo House sound makes use of a melodic 
repeated piano chord progression, diva vocals, a 4/4 beat with a tempo 
of around 120-122bpm. During this time, Italo House musicians, producers
 also featured acid sounds within their music and ventured as far as 
producing Techno, some producers also incorporated the exciting piano 
sound that had now become the basis of Italo House within some of their 
Techno releases.

            The best known example of Italo House, as already mentioned 
is ‘Ride on Time’ by ‘Black Box’. Black Box, along with the ‘FPI 
Project’, Media Records ‘Cappella’ and the ‘49ers’ made the genre very 
popular in the late 80’s and early 90’s with their very uplifting songs.

           The original name ‘Italo House’ slowly drifted away around 
1991 / 1992 and it later became known as Italian-House, especially in 
the UK, but the sound stayed the same ‘happy and euphoric’ pioneered 
essentially by the production stable of Discomagics Severo Lombardoni 
and Media Records Gianfranco Bortolotti. The latter carrying on the 
Italo House sound well into the mid-90s, whose alter egos included 
Cappella, RAF, East Side Beat and the 49ers to name but a few. The music
 produced in Italy dominated the British dance charts and clubs of the 
very early 90s (1990/1991)  with songs like:- Asha – JJ Tribute / DJ H 
feat Stefy – Think About / Pierre Feroldi – Movin Now / Last Rhythm – 
Last Rhythm and Jinny – Keep warm, all expressing a happy vibe &amp; 
atmosphere.

                 Probably the most well known Label and Distributor of 
the Italo House genre would have to be Discomagic Records in Rome, which
 had many subsidiary labels that featured Italo House music. This was by
 far the largest italo Disco / House / Dance record label in Italy at 
the time and was run by Severo Lombardoni. This label along with Media 
Records set the standards for an entire genre of music.
In 1991, artists such as K-Klass, Bassheads, Love Decade etc. all 
created excellent House music that incorporated piano chords that was 
typical of the time when Italo House ruled the Northern UK House music 
scene. DJs such as Sasha championed the Italo House sound and featured 
the genre heavily within his sets. Clubs like Shelley’s, the Hacienda 
and Legends where also well known for playing Italo House in 1990 and 
1991 with Legends being well known for playing more of the obscure Italo
 House.

               To this day Italo House music is collected far and wide 
by keen, avid record collectors, all chasing that illusive Italo House /
 Italian-House track/tracks with some costing the buyer £100 +. These 
fanatics of Italo House have become known as ‘Italo House Aficionados’.

broadly to describe dance music from outside of Italy and from different

 is essentially Eurodance (or Euro House) music produced in Italy. More 
specifically, it is a subgenre of House music that was popular in 
nightclubs during the 1990’s in most of Europe, but particularly in 
Italy. Very formulaic, this style makes heavy use of synthesizers: 
strong basslines, pounding beats, with a set tempo anywhere between 120 
and 160 beats per minute. A typical song will have male rappers sing the
 verses and female singers perform the chorus, but variations of that 
formula are frequent. Songs featuring heavy sampling are not rare. 
Instrumental releases were also fairly frequent.

While Eurodance was born out of cross-influence between various genres, 
including Hip-Hop, House, Disco and Hi-NRG, Italodance takes heavier 
inspiration from the 1980’s Italo Disco, with several producers from the
 Italo Disco era crossing over, giving Italodance a distinct sound from 
Eurodance.

Italodance production covers the entire span of the 1990’s, but reached 
its peak in 1993 up to 1996. During this era, production was absolutely 
massive; many records were being quickly produced, which leaded to 
inconsistent output quality between releases. Nevertheless, the 
Italodance wave created a fair amount of internationally successful 
acts, such as Whigfield, Ice MC, Corona, Da Blitz, U.S.U.R.A., Double 
You, Alexia, Gala and others. The genre is sometimes expanded to include
 late 90’s/early 2000’s acts such as Eiffel 65, the latter work of Gigi 
d’Agostino and Paps &amp; Skar, which were also very successful 
overseas.</span></li></a>

 is a hardcore techno style that emerged during the mid 90’s and was 
popularized by labels such as Sharpnelsound and ALiCE’S EMOTiON. 
Specifically, J-Core is a variation of Happy Hardcore and Gabber. It’s 
known for fast-paced heavy sampling, often high-pitched vocals and 
incorporates many “otaku” themes, such as anime, videogames or typical 
japanese pop culture. More broadly, the term is also used as an umbrella
 term for a wide range of hard electronic music featuring these themes, 
ranging from jungle/breakbeat to speedcore. For a long time there was no
 term coined for this kind of music, but when this style gained 
international fame the term was coined around 2005 and from then on this
 style of music was referred to as J-Core.

During the mid 90’s, Japan had a rich underground hardcore scene, but at
 one point the Japanese scene began to divide with one movement sticking
 to the original european style of hardcore (such as Bass2 Records and 
Teikoku Records), and another moving towards a “geek culture” kind of 
hardcore (such as Sharpnelsound, Toy Label and Murder Yacht School). 
This second movement was very much about self-made doujin (fandom) 
releases, not bothered by copyright since it was a very underground 
niche culture at the time. As a result, many albums feature unlicensed 
remixes and in recent years some labels have had to shut down the 
production of these albums or face consequences.

During the 2000’s record labels such as ALiCE’S EMOTiON, C.H.S and 
X-Treme Hard started to emerge which brought a more polished sound to 
the scene and started to become more mainstream as the years progressed.
 At this time the scene also gained international fame. Various stores 
sold the albums internationally and events across the border started to 
happen too (such as Hardcore Synergy at Anime Central).

Nowadays, many of the artists that made a name for themselves in the

hundreds of new fan-made albums a year at events such as Comiket or M3

 Discogs, Jazzdance is a vague synonym for Acid Jazz and other music in a
 similar style.

When first added to Discogs, it was envisioned as another name for late 
1990s Acid Jazz, or the slower side of Future Jazz. However, the term is
 also said to have been used in the 1980s among Northern Soul nightclub 
DJs, in reference to some of the 1950s–1980s funk, soul, and jazz music 
they curated for the dancefloor. Relatively obscure selections from that
 scene became known as Rare Groove by 1985, and the terms Acid Jazz and 
Dancefloor Jazz were coined soon after to market contemporary acts 
playing in a Jazzdance/Rare Groove style.

Some background:

In early 2001, former Discogs user SayVegin [proposed Future 
Jazz](https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/1205) as an Electronic style 
tag for bands like Jazzanova, Fila Brazillia, and A Forest Mighty Black.
 He then [proposed 
Jazzdance](https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/1231#11569) “for acts 
like Mr. Gone, Down To The Bone, Soulstance which have a more 
dance-oriented tempo”.

With these examples, there is little to differentiate jazzdance from 
acid jazz. At that time, the uptempo bossa and samba-infused 
nu-jazz/future-jazz music of Jazzanova was very similar to that of Mr. 
Gone and Soulstance. Meanwhile, Fila Brazillia’s midtempo, funky, 
sometimes-housey acid jazz sound was not much different from the music 
of Down To The Bone.

In mid-2017, Discogs user cheebacheebakid, a former DJ in the genre, 
[provided the broader 
definition](https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/748381#7424627), saying
 Jazzdance encompassed all styles of jazz that were dancefloor friendly 
in the 1980s and beyond: “Jazzdance (without the space) was one way 
Gilles, Forge, et. al. referred to Rare Groove in the early 80s as 
played at Dingwall’s, Ronnie Scott’s, The Jazz Cafe, etc. Like Northern 
Soul (from which it kind of branched off), they were catch-all terms for
 highly danceable jazz (usually Latin or Brazilian inflected). Often 
Dancefloor Jazz was used as well, moreso by labels like Mojo, 
LuvNHaight, etc.. It morphed into Acid Jazz as a marketing term when 
Acid House got huge in late 80s. Then soon after Acid Jazz meant modern 
acts playing Jazzdance/Rare Groove style music (e.g., Snowboy, BNH, JTQ,
 etc) and now it iseems Jazzdance is used on anything remotely 
toe-tappable with a horn or Hammond.”

Hardcore, often using the same breakbeats and the same equipment. Jungle
 is characterized by high tempos (160 to 175 BPM being the average), 
chopped-up and often seemingly random breakbeat sequencing, heavy 
basslines, Reggae influence, and the iconic sound of Akai cyclic 
timestretch. Jungle also focuses on a sense of atmospheric intelligence 
contrasting with the violent sound of high tempo drums and basslines, 
juxtaposing the sounds of Romplers and samples of New-Age songs with the
 heavy, relentless chopping of breaks such as the famous Amen break. It 
is said to have given birth to such genres as Drum And Bass and 
Breakcore.</span></li></a>

 Techno is not to be confused with Nerdcore Hip Hop. It is coincidental 
that these were named similarly.

Nerdcore Techno is a style of Techno that emerged in Japan in the early 
90’s and was popularized by labels such as 
[全日本レコード](https://www.discogs.com/label/936329) and [Toy 
Label](https://www.discogs.com/label/69643) as well as Jungle/Techno 
collective [サイケアウツ](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1116830). It is most 
often seen as a combination of Techno, Breakbeat and Jungle, known for 
remixing melodies/heavy sampling of typical Japanese (and occassionally 
western) pop culture and incorporating a comedic and/or nostalgic 
undertone. Often referencing either campy 80’s and 90’s pop culture or 
otaku/nerd culture such as anime or videogames, there is some overlap 
with [J-Core](https://reference.discogslabs.com/style/j-core) 
artists/labels, and Nerdcore Techno can be seen as the foundation of 
[J-Core](https://reference.discogslabs.com/style/j-core). But while 
[J-Core](https://reference.discogslabs.com/style/j-core) focuses on the 
Hardcore side of things, Nerdcore Techno focuses on the Techno and 
Jungle side of music. The BPM can vary a lot depending on the artist’s 
personal style but it often ranges between 130 and 160 BPM, leaning 
towards the higher BPMs and can sometimes go as high as 180 BPM.

Nerdcore Techno’s origins seem to draw inspiration from early techno 
acts like [Yellow Magic 
Orchestra](https://www.discogs.com/artist/22061-Yellow-Magic-Orchestra) 
and [Kraftwerk](https://www.discogs.com/artist/4654-Kraftwerk). One of 
the earliest known examples of what could be reasonably be considered 
nerdcore is a track called サイバー長介 by 猛毒 (https://youtu.be/q7440o6YTkk), 
released in 1992.

Many underground events focused on Nerdcore Techno were held and 
articles appeared on Nerdcore Techno during the 90’s in Quick Japan, a 
prolific music magazine. At the peak of its popularity it had a 
significant following in Japan, though it remains largely an unseen, 
fleeting and mysterious movement outside of Japan. Today, Nerdcore 
Techno continues to live on mostly on the internet in the form of 
netlabels such as [Anything 
Records](https://www.discogs.com/label/178394), but there are still 
examples of labels that organize parties and release (pressed) physical 
releases. Toy Label (among others) still regularly releases physical 
albums, and overseas it has gained some traction as well in the form of 
labels such as [NiTEFLARE](https://www.discogs.com/label/188528) and 
[Allkore](https://www.discogs.com/label/150242). </span></li></a>

 Age is a marketing term used for various forms of soft, melodic, 
instrumental music, often intended for relaxation or “easy” listening. 
It tends to be made with synthesizers or digital keyboards, played in 
traditional styles (as a piano ordinarily would be), although it can 
lean toward the experimental as well. On the experimental side, it 
includes a broad range of ambient music, space music, field recordings 
of nature sounds (rainfall, lightning, trees rustling, animals, etc.), 
and may feature chanting or drone noises. However, it almost always 
emphasizes tonal sounds and a lead melody. Strong modal harmonies may be
 present. It does not resemble dance music and is usually made by people
 with no connection to underground or even mainstream dance scenes.</span></li></a>

 Beat was a wave of electronic dance music specific to the Belgian club 
scene from around 1987 and into 1990, with its greatest popularity in 
1988 and 1989. New Beat was often characterized by a relatively slow 
beat incorporating samples, synths and hypnotic bass lines. There’s not a
 lot of “pure” New Beat music; it was always a fusion genre, constantly 
incorporating the sounds of other popular dance music of its era, 
including synth-pop, EBM/industrial dance, electro, house, acid house, 
and to a lesser extent, Detroit techno.

New Beat had a significant, reciprocal influence on the stabby, buzzy 
“rave” aesthetic in techno music. Influences from New Beat evolved into 
the foundation of trance music (e.g. Age of Love’s “The Age of Love” and
 Revelation’s “First Power”/”Synth-It”).

New Beat faded into history as its artists increasingly converted to 
making higher-tempo music more strongly associated with techno or 
trance.

In between of New Beat and Belgium Techno around 1989 there was Hard 
Beat, also named Skizzo but mostly used is the term Hard Beat for that 
transition sound of 1988 New Beat to 1990 Belgium Techno sound. (e.g. 
Boy Toy – Touch My Body and Nasty Thoughts – Rock The House)</span></li></a>

 emerged in the early 2000s as a contemporary, mostly electronic 
interpretation of disco music.

Most nu-disco has no named sub-style or clearly defining 
characteristics, other than being rhythmically disco-based and not 
fitting into any other genre.

Nu-Disco often makes use of the standard disco rhythm (kick drum on 
every beat and a closed hi-hat on every eighth note), rather than the 
“high-energy” disco rhythm which underpins much house music (same kick 
but with an open hi-hat on the “off beat”, i.e. every eighth note in 
between). It may also incorporate 1980s Italo Disco-style synths &amp; 
drum machines.

Some nu-disco is simply re-edits (sometimes with added effects) of 
original-era disco &amp; boogie tracks. Some nu-disco is in a 
slowed-down “slow motion”/”cosmic” style. Some is quite fast and “hard” 
and can be more precisely described as “electro-disco” or 
“electro-house” depending on its resemblance to electro, electroclash, 
disco, and house. Some nu-disco has a very retro, Italo-Disco inspired 
sound but probably should not be tagged as Italo-Disco.

 House’s roots are primarily in the U.K. in the beginning of the ’90s, 
typified by producers like William Orbit, with his Guerilla label, and 
Leftfield, with their Hard Hands label. Two British DJs, Sasha &amp; 
John Digweed helped popularize the sound in the club “Renaissance”. The 
label Limbo Records launched from legendary Glasgow record store 23rd 
Precinct was also a major actor of the style. One of the biggest hits of
 the genre was “Passion” by Gat Decor.

Typical elements of the style are house rhythms around 125 BPM; a dubby,
 galloping/chugging bassline; and a dreamy, spacey atmosphere. In a 
sense, it is a combination of house and trance, with the soulful, 
booty-shaking elements toned down and replaced by long chords and dubby 
ear candy. It evolved into a more minimalistic aesthetic with the 
emergence of a new scene in 2003 led by musician/DJs such as James 
Holden &amp; Nathan Fake from the label Border Community.

Related styles are Progressive Breaks, Progressive Trance, and 
Progressive Psytrance. It’s often difficult to say a particular track is
 strictly progressive house, progressive breaks, or progressive trance, 
so people often lump the three genres together under a single 
“progressive” catch-all.</span></li></a>

 from the Goa Trance, Psychedelic Trance is more dusky &amp; repetitive 
than the original orientation of the style. There are also less 
multi-layered melodies; making the sound more techno-like. The style 
emerged during the year 1998 with German productions from X-Dream or 
Planet BEN. The Scandinavian artists also brought a major influence to 
the style with a colder and harder sound. Artists like Atmos, Koxbox or 
Son Kite made it popular till 2002.

With technology the style has developed immensely, starting to sound 
like the modern psy-trance at around 2003-2004.

Among the most influential artists in the genre are Infected Mushroom, 
GMS, Astral Projection, 1200 Mics and Talamasca.
Some of the most popular names that have been active the past 15 years 
are artists such as Sesto Sento, Vibe Tribe, Phanatic, InterSys, Soniq

styles of Electronic dance music. Rhythmic Noise, aka power noise, 
should not be confused with Power Electronics, which is not influenced 
by Electronic dance music and is closer to harsh Noise. Its origins are 
predominantly European.

Rhythmic Noise takes inspiration from a number of Industrial artists. 
Some of the most influential include Esplendor Geométrico from Spain, 
active since 1980, and Le Syndicat from France, active since 1982. The 
Belgian artist Dive also anticipated the style in the early 90s and went
 on to also form a purely Rhythmic Noise parallel project, Sonar, in the
 mid-90s. Some releases on the harder and harsher end of the Techno 
spectrum have also been influential such as the early EPs by Aphex Twin.
 EBM music (also known as Industrial dance music) and electro-Industrial
 music styles have also been big influences on the style’s development.

The synonymous term “power noise” was coined by Raoul Roucka of Noisex 
in 1997, with the track “United (Power Noise Movement)”.

The genre gained larger exposure to the U.S. industrial scene by the 
electro-Industrial act Wumpscut, who signed Noisex to the label Mental 
Ulcer Forges.

Some other notable Rhythmic Noise artists operating around that time 
included Imminent Starvation, P·A·L, Sonar,  Winterkälte, and various 
projects from members of Ars Moriendi.

Some notable Rhythmic Noise artists that emerged during the turn of the 
century include Converter, Antigen Shift, Iszoloscope, Mono No Aware and
 Terrorfakt.

The two most prominent labels known for Rhythmic Noise are Ant-Zen and 
Hand Productions. Both labels starting focusing more on releasing 
Rhythmic Noise during the late 90s.

There have often been very similar sounds coming from the harder, 
harsher or more experimental areas of the Techno spectrum which, at 
times, has been embraced by those into Rhythmic Noise. Examples of this 
such would be late 90s/Y2K era Speedy J, or releases on labels like 
Uncivilized World or Zhark Recordings. However, since these scenes were 
somewhat insulated from each other, they often didn’t use the same style
 descriptions.
DJ and Techno producer Adam X started trying to bridge the gap between 
these scenes around the year 2000.
Some artists producing harder, harsher, or more experimental sounds in 
other styles, such as Drum n Bass artist Panacea, have crossed over and 
have also been an influence in the style’s development.

Characteristics:
Typically, Rhythmic Noise is instrumental, based upon distorted sounds 
with distorted drums and other distorted percussive sounds often being 
the primary focus. Sometimes a melodic component is added, but this is 
usually secondary to the rhythm. Rhythmic Noise tracks are typically 
structured and danceable, but are occasionally more abstract and 
experimental. The genre is showcased at the annual Maschinenfest 
festival in Oberhausen, Germany, as well a number of other festivals.

Some groups, such as Combichrist and Dulce Liquido, merge Rhythmic Noise
 along with aggrotech (an EBM/electro-Industrial style) or even merge 
Rhythmic Noise with more commercial dance styles. Others, such as 
Tarmvred, meld the style with Breakcore. Others still, merge elements of
 IDM, such as Endif.

The 2010s has seen a resurgence of the harder, harsher and more 
experimental sounds in Techno which crosses over a lot with the sounds 
of Rhythmic Noise, although this is usually just known as industrial 
Techno, instead of Rhythmic Noise (or power noise or noize) because 
people in these two scenes were often unaware of each other’s music.
However, the Techno artist Ancient Methods (one of the artists 
responsible for the resurgence of industrial Techno), sampled Rhythmic 
Noise artist P·A·L’s track Gelöbnis on their second release from 2008, 
and Ancient Methods later released some music on Hands Productions which
 is one of the first labels that started heavily pushing the Rhythmic 
Noise sound back in the 90s.
An example of an artist that was once known more primarily in the 
Rhythmic Noise scene and is now well-known within the Techno scene would
 be Orphx.
Ancient Methods and Orphx have also collaborated together under the name
 Eschaton with releases on the Techno label, Token.
Newer artists such as Ontal and Tomohiko Sagae have been releasing music
 on both Techno labels and Rhythmic Noise labels.

There has also been and continues to be crossovers within other sounds 
and scenes such as the Breakcore and IDM scenes.</span></li></a>

 as a Discogs style tag, can apply to pretty much any [pop 
music](https://www.discogs.com/genre/pop) dominated by synthetic sounds.
 Before non-electronic music was allowed in the database, the tag was 
applied quite liberally in order to justify the inclusion of dance 
records from the pop and 
[R&amp;B](https://www.discogs.com/style/contemporary+r%26b) club scenes,
 and is still used fairly broadly.

The synth-pop genre, though, primarily originates in late 1970s/early 
1980s [New Wave](https://www.discogs.com/style/new+wave), the post-punk 
“alternative” rock movement that encompasses a wide range of styles and 
attitudes. There are some non-New Wave synth-pop bands like Pet Shop 
Boys, but on the whole, the synth-pop scene of the 1980s was dominated 
by a faction of New Wave bands that embraced the use of electronic 
instruments and relatively light, dance-oriented songwriting, yet still 
retained a fairly typical four-piece rock-band structure (percussion, 
lead instrument, bass instrument, vocal). Most synth-pop combines 
electronic and other instruments, plus strong vocals and melodies, and 
elements of whatever dance music styles are popular at the time. The 
music generally isn’t very experimental, serious, or dark, but some 
synth-pop bands like [The Human 
League](https://www.discogs.com/artist/10383-The-Human-League) and 
members of the “minimal wave” scene explored a more alternative, moody 
sound at times. Synth-pop enjoys revivals now and then, with new bands 
deliberately paying homage to the old sounds, or just stumbling onto a 
similar aesthetic in their experimentation with styles.</span></li></a>

 is a term that has been applied to a subgenre of New Wave music that 
began in the late-1970s with the rise of affordable electronic 
instruments such as synthesizers and sequencers. It became popular in 
the 1980s with artists such as Depeche Mode, Anne Clark, KaS Product, 
Gary Numan, John Foxx, Fad Gadget and others. The term is related 
to/overlaps with subbranches such as Minimal wave, Cold wave, and Dark 
wave.

In the mid-2010s, the term also became associated with an ’80s revival 
style that draws on Italo-disco music and electronic soundtracks of many
 1980s films, video games, cartoons and television shows. It 
incorporates or closely imitates the sound of vintage analogue 
synthesizers, drum machines, and effects and has been described as 
“retrofuturistic”. Despite being named as if it were a branch of 
synthesizer-based New Wave music, there is no direct relationship 
between the latter revivalist genre and aforementioned New Wave style, 
nor with New Wave generally.</span></li></a>

 genre is a bit difficult to define, since there are different schools 
of thought regarding its production and sound. Some of the earlier 
tracks of the genre tried to integrate a 1/2 tempo dub sample, whereas 
some Chicago DJs early on in the scene wanted to create a “harder” sound
 (e.g. releases from Relief Records). Techno and House music have a 
shared history and compatible sounds, so Tech House releases often 
combine elements from both styles, usually inconsistently; some releases
 borrow more heavily from techno, others from house. This lends itself 
to a gray area in defining a recognizable sound that has persisted since
 its conception, through the 90’s and 00’s, and into today.</span></li></a>

 subgenre of trance that developed in the mid-1990s that is heavily 
influenced by techno. It is characterized by the emphasis of 
synthesizers, rhythms, percussions and basslines rather than melodies.
Tech Trance is sounds like the name also suggests how it would sound 
like;
Typically nowadays has a Trance song structure following with Techno 
sounds. The purest form of Tech Trance has a Techno song structure and 
trancy sounds. This type of Techno used to be called Trance back in the 
early 00’s and and in the 90s, but as time had also passed by, Tech 
Trance took a complete 180 and instead went into a full blown scene. It 
wasn’t experimental no more. It was a sensation, Energy, Trance energy. 
Very notable artists of the genre would defintly be Sander van Doorn aka
 Sam Sharp, Mark Sherry, Marco V, and Marcel Woods. In the late 00’s 
Tech Trance started to evolve into Electro Trance by the very Marcel 
Woods himself. Sander van Doorn was very keen to the emerging Electro 
trend aswell and also went along with him. In the very late 00’s Tech 
Trance has gone underground again, even if there was any sign of it, it 
still wasn’t truly Tech Trance no more. In the early 2010’s Tech Trance 
or may I even say Electro Trance took another course. It started to 
sound very bland, overcompressed and kind of cheap. Trance fans noticed 
the change and quickly were calling the genre Trouse (Trance and House. 
Well, the internet was wrong once again since the emrging sound had 
nothing to do with Trance nor House. We could say that what came, was 
just like another wave of rave. It actually sounded very much alike to 
the old skool Rave aswell, however the genre got a name – Big Room 
House. Nowadays it’s EDM, because this seems to be the most politically 
correct gentrification, right? Well, thats the breif history of Tech 
Trance.

How it really sounds like? Take the advise from me and never trust Armin
 van Buuren’s words about Trance nor Armada’s. Armin ruined Trance once,
 Armada once again. No, Tech Trance does not sound like a melacholic 
squarewave symphony what Armada seems to pull onto people, but rather 
fast-paced, percussive, systematic and complex from sound design. What 
separates Techno from Tech Trance is that Tech Trance creates a 
sensation, while Techno doesn’t. What separates Trance from Tech Trance 
is the atmosphere and thus it’s not classified as a subgenre of Techno, 
but rather Trance.

How does Techno sound like? Cold, systematic, futuristic, percussive, 
hypnotic.

How does Trance sound like? Hypnotic, spiritual, somewhat melodic, 
somewhat could be euphoric, sensational.

Combining two doesn’t take a genius to understand how the result would 
sound like.</span></li></a>

 first proto-Techno/Electro release was Cybotron’s ‘Alleys Of Your Mind’
 in 1981. That same year, a group by the name of ‘A Number Of Names’ 
released another important and influentional song called ‘Sharivari’. 
While both of those songs aren’t pure Techno, they are the roots of the 
sound and a very important part of the history.

The term Techno (specifically relating to the music genre) was first 
used on the 1984 EP by Cybotron called ‘Techno City’. It was also used 
on the 1988 compilation ‘Techno! The New Dance Sound Of Detroit’. Juan 
Atkins, one half of Cybotron, was the first person to use the term to 
specifically describe the regional dance sound of Detroit. Atkins and 
the other purveyors of the sound – Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and 
Eddie Fowlkes – comprise what is known as ‘The First Wave’ (pre-1988).

Other notable early artists are Blake Baxter, James Pennington, and 
Anthony Shakir. The second wave of Techno artists, from 1988 onward, 
notably consisted of Jeff Mills, Mike Banks (of Underground Resistance),
 Carl Craig, Richie Hawtin, Rob Hood, Dave Angel, Kenny Larkin, Dan 
Bell, Drexciya, Stacey Pullen, Orlando Voorn, Kelli Hand, and Octave One

 emerged as a form of electronic dance music around 1990, with the 
advent of music that was essentially techno or house, but had simplified
 percussion, extreme repetition, and other hypnotic effects such as 
sustained chords and long echoes. Trance generally has no “bump” in its 
percussion or “groove” in its basslines — that is, the hi-hats and the 
bass in the kick drum are generally de-emphasized as compared to house 
or techno, and the basslines tend to consist of flat tones, with no 
modulation, confined to a small range of notes. Trance tempos are 
generally a little faster than techno, but can vary considerably. 
Additional info: Trance Production section of the Trance article on 
Wikipedia.

In trance’s early years (1990-1992), it wasn’t always clear whether a 
track was just “trancey” techno (or even beat-laden “ambient” or “deep” 
house), or was actually an example of what would later be called simply 
“trance”. Consequently, on Discogs, such music might be tagged as (for 
example) both Trance and Techno. Example artists in this category and 
time period include The Shamen, Psychick Warriors Ov Gaia, The 
Irresistible Force, and Speedy J. From the New Beat scene, Age of Love’s
 1990 self-titled hit single is sometimes pointed to as the earliest 
“pure” trance track. Similarly, some tracks from the Acid House era, 
such as original versions of The KLF’s “What Time Is Love?” (issued in 
sleeves that say “Pure Trance”) were called house or acid house at the 
time, but are retroactively considered by some to be trance or 
proto-trance.

The first wave of what many now consider to be “classic” trance peaked 
in 1992 and waned in 1994, and was dominated by producers and labels 
from Germany and the UK. Key labels include Eye Q/Harthouse, Rising 
High, FAX, ESP, and MFS. Hits include Jam &amp; Spoon “Stella”, Jaydee 
“Plastic Dreams”, Sequential “Prophet”, Transform “Transformation”, 
Cygnus X “Superstring”. Other artists of note from this wave include 
Sven Väth, Cosmic Baby, The Drum Club, The Sabres of Paradise, Horizon 
222, Biosphere, Lumukanda, James Bernard, and Oliver Lieb. On Discogs, 
this music is generally tagged as just Trance.

In the mid-1990s, although it wasn’t new, harder-edged, faster, more 
aggressive sounding trance (Hard Trance, Acid Trance) became more 
popular than the mellower, more tonal classic sound. Similarly, it was 
in the mid-1990s that busier, more psychedelic/ear-candy-laden forms of 
trance became the norm rather than the exception. On Discogs, this music
 is generally tagged according to which style it is Goa Trance, 
Progressive Trance, and Psy-Trance), but plain old Trance can be used if
 the specific variety isn’t known. When these styles became more 
popular, the more basic, classic sound became marginalized, and it did 
not really re-emerge until the early 2000s, when classic trance-infused 
techno/tech-house (sometimes called Neo-Trance) became popular. This 
newer sound is generally tagged with Trance, along with whatever other 
style applies, indicating it has elements of both.

Meanwhile, the mid and late 1990s also saw commercial, “clubby” forms of
 trance or trance/house hybrids become very popular, especially in 
Europe. These tracks often include vocals, overt melodies, and 
traditional A-A-B-A song structures, and may include remixes of 1980s 
pop hits. This category of commercial trance music encompasses a range 
of styles, and boundaries are a bit blurred. Tags on such items tend to 
include, in various combinations, Progressive Trance, Progressive House,
 Euro House, Trance, House, and sometimes Techno. Example artists in 
this commercial/clubby category from the late 1990s and early 2000s 
include DJ Tiësto, Ferry Corsten, ATB, William Orbit, Dirty Vegas, Tall 
Paul, Peter Rauhofer.</span></li></a>

 house music combined with world music, tribal house is characterised by
 heavy use of percussion (typically conga drums or their synthesized 
derivative) over a house tempo (120/125 BPM).

Tribal house roots are primarily in Florida, where the Caribbean 
percussive sound hugely influenced the post-electro scene; Rey 
Rodriguez, Tony Carrasco, MURK and George Acosta were the forerunners 
there and contributed to establishing Miami as a major clubbing town. 
Tribal house gained popularity from the early 90s into the early 00s, 
especially in New York, due to producers like Kenny “Dope” Gonzalez, 
Eric Kupper (alias K-Scope), Danny Tenaglia, Hex Hector and Mac Quayle 
(alias HQ2), Barry Harris and Chris Cox (alias Thunderpuss), Peter 
Rauhofer (alias Club 69), Little Louie Vega, Ralphi Rosario and Abel 
Aguilera (alias Rosabel), Victor Calderone and Junior Vasquez, amongst 
others.

There is also a Benelux school, which is a legacy of carnival tradition 
similar as in Central &amp; South America; the labels Wonka Beats, 
Touché, Outland and Global Cuts are representatives of it. The London UK
 school takes more influences from Jamaican sounds like raggamuffin and 
integrated them in progressive house with leftfield; examples being 
Fabio Paras and KLF.</span></li></a>

 hop (sometimes used synonymously with “downtempo”) is a musical genre 
that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially 
Bristol. It has been described as “a fusion of hip hop and electronica 
until neither genre is recognizable”, and may incorporate a variety of 
styles, including funk, dub, soul, psychedelia, R&amp;B, and house, as 
well as other forms of electronic music. Trip hop can be highly 
experimental.

Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the
 British music media to describe the more experimental variant of 
breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene in the early 1990s, 
which contained influences of soul, funk, and jazz. It was pioneered by 
acts like Massive Attack, Tricky, and Portishead. Trip hop achieved 
commercial success in the 1990s, and has been described as “Europe’s 
alternative choice in the second half of the ’90s.”</span></li></a>

 garage (also known as UKG) is a genre of electronic music originating 
from England in the early 1990s. The genre usually features a 
distinctive syncopated 4/4 percussive rhythm with ‘shuffling’ hi-hats 
and beat-skipping kick drums. Garage tracks also commonly feature 
‘chopped up’ and time-shifted or pitch-shifted vocal samples 
complementing the underlying rhythmic structure at a tempo usually 
around 128 to 140 BPM. UK garage was largely subsumed into other styles 
of music and production in the mid-2000s, including dubstep, bassline 
and grime. The decline of UK garage during the mid-2000s saw the birth 
of UK funky, which is closely related.

 is a genre that emerged in the early 2010s. It is often characterized 
by a nostalgic fascination with retro cultural aesthetics, commercial 
fragments, and technology, as well as a critical or parodic 
preoccupation with consumer capitalism, popular culture, ’80s yuppie 
culture, and new-age tropes.

Vaporwave grew out of styles such as witch house and chillwave, as well 
as related internet communities. Musically, it is often characterized by
 its heavy use of samples from late ’70s, ’80s, ’90s and early 2000s 
popular music as well as lounge, smooth jazz or elevator music. Samples 
are often pitched, layered or altered in classic chopped and screwed 
style.

Vaporwave is also home to a multitude of sub-genres, which include the 
following: mallsoft, which combines the typical vaporwave style with a 
reverb-heavy, atmospheric sound, and utilizes themes of shopping and the
 buildings in which it occurs – vaportrap, which typically puts ambient 
synths and pads with trap-styled drum patterns atop its samples – future
 funk, a more upbeat take on vaporwave that is reminiscent of nu-disco 
both in production and sound – vapornoise, which typically lathers the 
original vaporwave style with distortion and glitches – broken 
transmission, a sub-genre that takes any one of these styles (typically 
the chopped-and-screwed approach) and applies it to samples taken from 
commercials and similar media – utopian virtual, an approach that tends 
to involve sounds akin to MIDI sequencing and a heavily electronic 
sound, mostly themed around the concept of perfect life – hypnagogic 
drift, a more ambient take on the chopped-and-screwed style, making 
copious use of phasers and delay – late night lo-fi, a style that 
primarily samples funk and R&amp;B to create a soulful atmosphere, and 
VHS pop, a style that combines the typical vaporwave style with punchy 
hip-hop beats.</span></li></a>

 house is an occult-themed dark electronic music genre and visual 
aesthetic that emerged in the early 2010s. The music is heavily 
influenced by chopped and screwed hip-hop soundscapes, industrial and 
noise experimentation, and features use of synthesizers, drum machines, 
obscure samples, droning repetition and heavily altered, ethereal, 
indiscernible vocals. The witch house visual aesthetic includes occult, 
witchcraft, shamanism and horror-inspired artworks, collages and 
photographs as well as significant use of typographic elements such as 
Unicode symbols. Many works by witch house visual artists incorporate 
themes from horror films, the television series Twin Peaks, and 
mainstream pop culture celebrities. Common typographic elements in 
artist and track names include triangles, crosses, and other Unicode 
symbols, which are seen by some as a method of keeping the scene 
underground and harder to search for on the Internet.</span></li></a>

 Guarania is a popular genre created and developed by [José Asunción 
Flores](https://www.discogs.com/artist/841111-Jos%C3%A9-Asunci%C3%B3n-Flores)
 in 1925 after several experiments.
Originally, was conceived as a symphonic poem on which, a 
[Flores](https://www.discogs.com/artist/841111-Jos%C3%A9-Asunci%C3%B3n-Flores)’
 friend, the poet [Manuel Ortiz 
Guerrero](https://www.discogs.com/artist/841108-Manuel-Ortiz-Guerrero) 
provided the lyrics and sometimes Flores composed over the [Ortiz 
Guerrero](https://www.discogs.com/artist/841108-Manuel-Ortiz-Guerrero)’s
 lyrics.
The most popular composition on this style is “India”.
Other world favorites are “Recuerdos De Ypacarai” and “Mis Noches Sin 
Ti”, recorded by notorious pop artists around the world such as [Julio 
Iglesias](https://www.discogs.com/artist/67331-Julio-Iglesias), [Gal

[Roberto Carlos](https://www.discogs.com/artist/286945-Roberto-Carlos) 
among others.
However being urban (the Guarania was originated in the capital city of 
Asunción, far away of rural areas) it’s considered a paraguayan folk 
style.</span></li></a>

 is a music genre that originated in Ghana at the turn of the 20th 
century and incorporated the traditional harmonic 9th, as well as 
melodic and the main rhythmic structures in traditional Akan music, and 
married them with Western instruments. Highlife was associated with the 
local African aristocracy during the colonial period. By 1930s, Highlife
 spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gambia and Nigeria via Ghanaian 
workers, amongst other West African countries, where the music is now 
very popular.

Highlife is characterized by jazzy horns and multiple guitars which lead
 the band. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound (see 
Daddy Lumba). Igbo highlife and Joromi are subgenres.

This arpeggiated highlife guitar part is modeled after an Afro-Cuban 
guajeo. The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3-2 
clave motif guajeo as shown below. The bell pattern known in Cuba as 
clave is indigenous to Ghana and Nigeria, and is used in Highlife.

 (various other spellings include Kronchong, Kroncong, etc.) is a 
popular music style which originated in the region now known as Malaysia
 and Indonesia. It was reputedly derived from local attempts to copy 
Portuguese popular songs brought to Malacca by traders and usually 
involved the use of stringed instruments. A local variant on the 
European lute resembling a ukulele was called the keroncong, so this may
 be how the style acquired its name.

Obvioulsy the style must have developed considerably over the time 
between the earliest European influences in the 16th century and modern 
times but there are no recorded examples before the early 20th century. 
By the time the earliest recordings were made (in Singapore in 1903 by 
The Gramophone Co. and in Batavia and Singapore in 1906 by Beka) 
keroncong was primarily a vocal style. Many similar recordings were made
 up until the early 1940s when all recording activity stopped due to the
 Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia. By this time accompaniments varied
 considerably and were not necessarily by the traditional group of 
stringed instruments (in some cases more modern instruments like the 
piano and saxophone were used). On most recordings the term keroncong 
applies to any popular vocal in the keroncong style whether stringed 
instruments were involved or not.

After WWII the recording of this style continued, but post-war 
recordings already show some new developments. While most pre-war 
keroncong records are played fast and sung in a high-pitched nasal 
voice, later recordings tend to be slower in tempo and the singing style
 is also different (becoming more similar to other forms of popular 
songs of that time). The keroncong style was still popular, but it began
 to lose it’s dominant role in the local culture as other types of music
 gained more influence.

For post-war recordings if the performance is not specified as keroncong
 (or some variant of that term) this tag should not be used. Although 
recordings of keroncong music continue up to the present day, by the 
late 1970s it had been largely overtaken by other forms. In the 1970s 
&amp; 1980s the dominant form in Indonesia was Dangdut. Although both 
Keroncong and Dangdut are well known forms of Indonesian popular music, 
they should be regarded as distinct styles and these tags would not 
normally be used together.</span></li></a>

 / Minyou is generic name of Japanese old trad song.
Since Min’yō is Japanese original music that continues from
ancient times to the present, it does not have a Western scale
and Western instruments are not used.
As rare case, singer sometimes sing along with Western instruments for 
contemporary music, but it will be Kayōkyoku.
Fusion, Jazz, and Easy Listening also has cover of Min’yo songs using 
Western instruments.
Even Disco and Funk have cover of Min’yo songs. They are crossover music
 using Min’yo famous songs.

The Western scale is seven scales. However, the Japanese scale is five 
scales.
The Japanese scale “ヨナ抜き” (Yona-nuki : “Yo” means 4, “Na” means 7, 
“Nuki” means Without)
It without using 4 “Fa” and 7 “Si”.
Also other Japanese scale “ニロ抜き”  (Niro-nuki : “Ni” means 2, “Ro” means 
6, “Nuki” means Without)
It without using 2 “Re” and 6 “La”.
The vocal does not have Kobushi (Enka vibrato).
You can judge Min’yō from this sound.
Or in many cases 民謡 is printed on cover and label so you can judge 
Min’yō.
民謡 is old trad song from all over Japan.
The area name is printed next to “民謡” credit.

These are the types of Minyou.

追分 Oiwake means the branch point of the Japanese country road.

甚句 Zinku (都々逸 Dodoitsu)

It is characterized by lyrics constituting 1 chorus
with 7, 7, 7 and 5 (都々逸 Dodoitsu).
Various lyrics were invented. 5, 7, 7, 5 in some cases.
Many folk songs throughout the country have this form.
There are both a melisma type and a syllable type.
A shout is inserted, which is often inserted before and after lyrics.

シマ唄 Shima-uta is Min’yō from 鹿児島県奄美群島 (Amami Islands)
which 沖縄 Okinawa and 鹿児島 Kagoshima people’ trad song.

And 労働歌 Roudouka = Work song. It belong under the Min’yō.
These traditional work songs are songs that have been inherited by 
workers from a long time ago.

馬子唄 Mago-Uta is a song for a person to sing while leading a horse.
It also called 馬追い歌 (Umaoi-Uta)、馬喰節 (Bakurou-Bushi).
Many lyrics are in Zinku style (1 chorus with 7, 7, 7 and 5)
It is difficult because it has melisma style and does not have a 
constant rhythm.
Likewise, cow songs fall into this category.

舟歌 Funa-Uta is Sailor’s song. It’s kind of Work song.

木遣唄 Kiyari-Uta is song for carrying heavy logs,
workmen’s chant while pulling a heavy load.

地突唄 Zitsuki-Uta, According to Japanese trad music classification,

盆踊りの歌 Bon-Odori song,
Bon Odori meaning simply Bon dance, is a style of dancing performed 
during Obon.
Originally a Nenbutsu folk dance to welcome the spirits of the dead,
the style of celebration varies in many aspects from region to region.
Each region has a local dance, as well as different music.
The music can be songs specifically pertinent to the spiritual message 
of Obon,
or local min’yō folk songs. Consequently, the Bon dance will look
and sound different from region to region.

音頭 Ondo,
An “Ondo,” usually refers to a kind of song with a distinct swung 2/2 
rhythm.
This “swing” can be referred to as “Ukare” in Japanese.
“Ondo” is a term used in older Japanese genres,
but it is still used today when referring to songs written in this 
swinging style.
Sometimes the rhythm is NOT swung and it is played straight through. 
This is called “Kizami”.
There are other names used to describe older Japanese genres of music.
For example, “Fushi” or “Bushi” (節), with its literal meaning of “node,”
 “knuckle,”
or “joint,” refers to the nodes found in bamboo,
usually found at a steady sequence.
Thus “Fushi” can also have the abstract idea of “sequence” to refer to 
notes
and beats in a sequence, i.e., a melody.

Not every old Japanese melody with a swung rhythm is called an “Ondo,”
as sometimes the term “Fushi” or “Bushi” is used to refer to a tune
with a swung 2/2 rhythm, both of these having more or less the same 
meaning
of “tune” or “melody.” The folk song Goshu Ondo,
for example, does not follow this rule, as the rhythm is NOT played in a
 swung fashion.
The folk song Tankō Bushi has a swung 2/2 rhythm,
even though it has “bushi” in its name.

In Japanese folk music, “Fushi” and “Ondo” follow the name of the song.
For example, Tokyo Ondo, Mamurogawa Ondo,
and Hanagasa Ondo all have “Ondo” in their names.
Kushimoto fushi, Burabura Bushi, and Soran Bushi all have a rendering
of “Bushi” or “Fushi” in their names.

Part of the Japanese Obon celebration involves participating in the 
local community dance.
The tradition of the Bon dance, or Bon odori (盆踊り), dates back a few 
hundred years,
and it is usually accompanied by the local tune.
In recent times, new music has been used for Bon dance accompaniment,
including late enka hits and music written specifically for bon dancing.
The “Ondo” rhythm has always been common in Japanese folk music,
but even the newer music written for Bon dances has been written in this
 style.

It is common to find names of newer music with the word “Ondo” attached 
to it.
For example, Japanese franchises such as anime, video games and
Tokusatsu TV series have their own ondo: the Pokémon Ondo, the Naruto 
Ondo,
the Hunter x Hunter Ondo, the Doraemon Ondo, Ojamajo Doremi Ondo,
Shiawase Kyoryu Ondo, the Love Live! Sunshine!! Sunshine Pikkapika Ondo
and even the Super Sentai series has several Ondo songs
such as Carranger Ondo, Bomb Dancing Megaranger, Hurricane Ondo,
Bakuryu Kazoeuta, Let’s Go On-do, Minna Summer DAY Ondo, Kyutama Ondo.
There is fan-made Touhou Ondo and DoDonPachi Ondo.
Ondo were commonly used as the opening themes for anime in the 1960s and
 70s,
especially with Tatsunoko Productions.
Even non-ondo music is starting to make the bon dance scene.
The selection ranges from traditional sounding Enka,
such as Hikawa Kiyoshi’s “Zundoko-bushi,” to more modern non-Japanese 
hits,
such as the Beach Boys’ “Kokomo.”

音頭 Ondo is a congratulatory song. For that reason Japanese major record 
companies have 演歌 Enka singers singing 音頭 Ondo. Because 音頭 Ondo belongs 
to  舞踊 Buyō, and it must be 民謡 Min’yō for the style. However, 音頭 Ondo 
which has been released in recent years has no 民謡 Min’yō  identity due 
to the diversity of Western musical instruments. It should be a 歌謡曲 
Kayōkyok.

騒ぎ唄 Sawagi-Uta.
Geisha sing to play with customers. Tempo is fast, lively and bright 
sound.
Geisha sang this to warm banquet up with shamisen and Japanese drum.

今様 Imayou / Imayō
A style of Japanese old songs. 今様 Imayou / Imayō means “Modern and 
Contemporary”
and it was the name meaning “Modern epidemic song” at the time.
In the Heian period (794 – 1185)
今様 Imayou / Ima yō occurred in the middle of the Heian period.
In the latter half of the Heian period, it was left in the record of the
 history book
that 後白河天皇 (Emperor Go-Shirakawa) loved it,
he was too passionate and had sore throat for 今様 Imayou / Imayō.
The lyrics are characterized by 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7 and 5 constituting 
one chorus,
and various lyrics were produced. Songs are syllables and melisma types.

Geisha sings old Japanese songs in response to customer requests.
That is not necessarily only Minyou.
Geisha was singing 歌謡曲 Kayōkyoku、長唄 Naga-Uta、
清元 Kiyomoto / Kiyomoto-bushi、民謡 Minyou、端唄 Ha-Uta、
小唄 Kouta、宮薗節 Miyazono-bushi / 薗八節 Sonohachi-bushi.
If 三味線 Shamisen is used, these kinds are often collectively called 
Min’yō / Minyou.

These all are the 舞踊 Buyō that geisha sang. It belongs to 民謡 Min’yō.

長唄 Naga-Uta, The official name is 江戸長唄 (Edo Nagauta).
長唄 Naga-Uta, literally “long song”, is a kind of traditional Japanese 
music which accompanies the kabuki theater. It was developed around 
1740. Influences included the vocal yōkyoku style used in noh theater, 
and instruments included the shamisen and various kinds of drums.

小唄 Kouta, The official name is 江戸小唄 (Edo Kouta).
小唄 Kouta is 俗謡 (Popular song) originally derived from the 端唄 Ha-Uta.
It was the Meiji (1868 – 1912) to Taisho (1912 – 1926) years that 
established as an abbreviation.
端唄 Ha-Uta uses 撥 Bachi (the plectrum for stringed instruments such as 
the shamisen and biwa) for the shamisen.
But 小唄 Kouta is finger picking.
In some cases, “小撥 Ko-Bachi” (Small Bachi) may be used.
端唄 Ha-Uta uses percussion instruments.
But 小唄 Kouta is a song only with a shamisen.
In recent years, there are also playing percussion instruments in 
special cases.
端唄 Ha-Uta sings flat. But 小唄 Kouta sings skillfully.
In this case, in order to give out the coolness which is the 
characteristic of the song, this technique must be not disgusting and 
disconcerting.

端唄 Ha-Uta is a collective term for short songs from the middle of the 
Edo period (1603 to1868).
Until the 1920s, songs were also called by the name of 小唄 Kouta,
but later it became clearly distinguishable from 端唄 Ha-Uta / 小唄 = 俗謡 
(Popular song). It was the Meiji (1868 – 1912) to Taisho (1912 – 1926) 
years that established as an abbreviation.

清元 Kiyomoto / Kiyomoto-bushi is one of the shamisen music,
a kind of 浄瑠璃 Jōruri (Jōruri is a form of traditional Japanese narrative
 music in which a 太夫 tayū sings to the accompaniment of a shamisen. As a
 form of storytelling, the emphasis is on the lyrics and narration 
rather than the music itself.) It is mainly used as accompaniment music 
of 歌舞伎 Kabuki and 歌舞伎舞踊 Kabuki Buyō (Kabuki’s dance tune).

宮薗節 Miyazono-bushi / 薗八節 Sonohachi-bushi.
One of the old songs of 浄瑠璃 Jōruri, the ancestor of 宮古路 薗八 (Sonohachi 
Miyakoji. the first generation, unknown birth and death year) in the 
middle of the Edo period (1603 to1868).

 (Azerbaijani: Muğam) is one of the many folk musical compositions from 
Azerbaijan, contrasting with tasnif and ashiks.

It is a highly complex art form that weds classical poetry and musical 
improvisation in specific local modes. Mugham is a modal system.Unlike 
Western modes, “mugham” modes are associated not only with scales but 
with an orally transmitted collection of melodies and melodic fragments 
that performers use in the course of improvisation. Mugham is a compound
 composition of many parts. The choice of a particular mugham and a 
style of performance fits a specific event. The dramatic unfolding in 
performance is typically associated with increasing intensity and rising
 pitches, and a form of poetic-musical communication between performers 
and initiated listeners.</span></li></a>

 music is an umbrella term used to refer to the music of the Sephardic 
Jewish community. Sephardic Jews have a diverse repertoire the origins 
of which center primarily around the Mediterranean basin. In the secular
 tradition, material is usually sung in dialects of Judeo-Spanish, 
though other languages including Hebrew, Turkish, Greek, and other local
 languages of the Sephardic diaspora are widely used. Sephardim maintain
 geographically unique liturgical and para-liturgical traditions.

Songs which are sung by women are traditionally sung while performing 
household tasks, without accompaniment or harmony. Tambourines and other
 percussion instruments are sometimes used, especially in wedding songs.
 Oud and qanún are also used in some instrumentations of Sephardic 
music, and more modern performers incorporate countless other imported 
instruments.</span></li></a>

 (German: literally, “people’s music” or as a Germanic connotative 
translation, “folk’s music”) is the common umbrella designation of a 
number of related styles of traditional folk music from the Alpine 
regions of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia and South Tyrol 
(Italy). It tends to be dialect-heavy and invokes local and regional 
lifestyles and traditions, particularly those of the Alpine farmers and 
peasants.
Originally transmitted by oral tradition, the oldest historical records 
like the Appenzell Kuhreihen by Georg Rhau (1488–1548) date back to the 
16th century. Volksmusik is characterized by improvisation and 
variation, uncomplicated major key melodies and simple harmonies. 
Typical instruments range from alpenhorns to hackbretts, zithers and 
acoustic guitars, and even violas and harmonicas. Harmonized singing is 
frequent, but other pieces may require yodeling, while instrumental 
arrangements are particularly frequent for fast dances or brass pieces.
Volksmusik continues to be performed by many local ensembles and bands 
throughout the European Alps and should not be confused with 
Volkstümliche Musik, which is largely to be found in broadcasting media 
and on ancillary merchandise. Since the 1970s, artists of a Neue 
Volksmusik genre, such as Werner Pirchner or Biermösl Blosn, attempt to 
combine traditional styles with jazz, folk, hip hop, rock et al. as a 
kind of world music. Popular proponents include Hubert von Goisern, 
Attwenger and Christine Lauterburg.
Additionally, also e.g. a Czech variant (Oberkrainer, Dechovka) does 
exist.
There has been much mix-up for this style, since ‘Volksmusik’ is the 
verbatim translation of ‘Folk music’. This style, however is very 
specific, the correct translation for ‘Folk music’ into German is 
‘volkstümliche Musik’. This discrepancy is described amongst others in 
the German Wikipedia article. The requested style is the specific style 
for the alpine branch, well described by the English Wikipedia aricle.</span></li></a>

 is a music genre that originated in the mid to late 1960s when 
African-American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of 
music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and R&amp;B. Funk 
de-emphasizes melody and harmony and brings a strong rhythmic groove of 
electric bass and drums to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on
 an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&amp;B 
and soul songs, which are built on chord progressions. Funk uses the 
same extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with 
added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered 
ninths.

rhythm pattern popularized by Washington, DC-based artists like Chuck 
Brown &amp; The Soul Searchers. This pattern uses syncopated mix of 
kick, snare, and relatively tonal elements like cowbell and congas. It 
has a loose, loping feel that alternates between high and low pitches.

Go-go hits include “Da Butt” by E.U. and “Hey, Fellas” by Trouble Funk.

This tag is not appropriate for music associated with go-go dancing, 
burlesque, dancers in cages, mid-1960s imagery of women in mini-skirts

On Discogs, there is the “Gogo” tag under Funk/Soul/R&amp;B, and “Go-Go”
 under Hip-Hop. These are referring to the same thing and ideally would 
both be named “Go-Go”. The one under Hip-Hop existed first and is just 
for go-go in more of a rap context.</span></li></a>

labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax labels were influential during 
the period of the civil rights movement. Soul also became popular around
 the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.

 the Hip Hop style, see Miami Bass or read further down below.

For the Electronic style: Bass Music is an umbrella term that refers to 
various styles of music including drum and bass, bassline, dubstep and 
UK garage among others. The phrase began to be used in response to the 
blending of sounds between these genres. The key characteristic shared 
among these genres are an emphasis on basslines, groove and rhythm.

Hip Hop Bass Music (sometimes referred to as Miami Bass) is a musical 
style that originated in the U.S. State of Florida in the mid-eighties. 
It is directly linked with electro-funk music from the early eighties 
and is known for its use of the Roland TR-808 kickdrums, sped up tempo 
and frequently sexually explicit lyrical content.

The style originated in Miami’s historically black neighborhoods such as
 Liberty City and Overtown, but also had shared influence from nearby 
Ft. Lauderdale, as well as Tampa Bay and Orlando. Maggotron a.k.a DXJ, 
Maggozulu 2, Planet Detroit and Bass Master Khan are considered pioneers
 of the sound, while it was popularized by acts such as the 2 Live Crew,
 Jam Pony Express, Gucci Crew II and DJ Magic Mike. Other well-known 
artists of the genre include the 69 Boyz, Truck Stop Boyz and the Quad 
City DJ’s

In the mid-eighties pirate radio was popular in Miami, where DJ’s would 
hijack radio airwaves and broadcast provocative and sexually explicit 
bass music from the safety of nearby boats off of the coast. This helped
 the style to gain further recognition, while adding to its 
controversial appeal. The style eventually spread to neighboring States,
 such as Georgia (mainly Atlanta) and the Carolinas as well as other 
nearby States.</span></li></a>

form of the Swahili word ubongo, meaning “brain”, referring to the 
‘street smarts’ contained in the lyrics and is also a nickname for the 
Capital city Dar Es Salaam, from where the style originated.

The term was first coined in 1996 by Radio One’s 99.6 FM’s DJ Mike 
Mhagama, who was seeking to distinguish the local movement from American
 hip-hop and R&amp;B. It is the most popular musical style amongst the 
Tanzanian youth today, having been pioneered by the likes of Mawingu 
Band, Dar Young Mob, DJ Boni Love, DJ Kim Magomelo and the Boyz, Adili 
a.k.a Nigga One and Mr. II.

Bongo Flava also draws on traditional Tanzanian musical styles like 
taarab and dansi, creating it’s own unique sound within the African 
hip-hop landscape. It is also a popular musical style in culturally

 bap is a style of production in hip-hop music. The term “boom bap” is 
an onomatopoeia for the drum sounds prominent in boom bap. It is usually
 recognized by an acoustic drum loop/break that is then chopped up and 
played using a sampler such as the Akai MPC or the SP1200. The term was 
popularized by the album Return of the Boom Bap by KRS-One.
Boom bap production was associated with producers from New York City in 
the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as DJ Premier, Pete Rock, KRS-One, 
Q-tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, EPMD, RZA, Marley Marl, Large Professor, 
Prince Paul and Scott La Rock. The production style was also employed by
 producers outside of New York City, such as J Dilla in Detroit and 
People Under The Stairs in Los Angeles.

Although it is still made, boom bap is no longer the dominant style of 
hip-hop production, remaining somewhat prominent in alternative hip hop 
but rarely appearing in Top 40 hip hop singles.[citation needed] In 
recent years the boom bap production style has made a slight comeback 
through artists such as Joey Bada$$,[1] Pro Era and associated acts.
·Having a “drunken” or “trippy” quality to its rhythm. Most other 
hip-hop beats has even eighth and sixteenth notes, but many examples of 
boom-bap are only even at the quarter note level — the eighth notes may 
be offbeat.

·Soul music, jazz, R&amp;B and reggae sampling is utilized. This could 
be said about 90s hip-hop in general though. Boom-bap beats are most 
often funky.

·Relatively less dense drum loops. Often, a boom-bap measure is just 
quarter notes (kick-snare-kick-snare). Eighth-notes are less emphasized 
but are crucial to making the boom-bap sound because they are placed 
offbeat to create that drunken or trippy quality. However, less dense 
drums does not mean it’s simpler — it takes craftsmanship to find 
samples that go well with snare drums.

·Pick-up notes. They tend to be very close to the upbeat of the note it 
picks up to, especially noticeable in the kick drum. Sometimes the note 
it picks up to is even substituted completely by the pick-up note.</span></li></a>

 is a sub-genre of rap that started in the projects of New Orleans, 
Louisiana. During its first years it did not have an official name, 
however sometime between (or after) DJ Jimi’s record and Everlasting 
Hitman’s “Bounce Baby, Bounce!”, everybody started calling the genre 
‘bounce’.

DJ Jimi, MC T Tucker &amp; DJ Irv are considered ‘founding fathers’ of 
bounce, although it started with artists rapping over a DJ looping 
breaks from The Showboys’ “Drag Rap” record (which is colloquially 
referred to as “Triggerman”).

While typically comprised from samples of “Triggerman”, The Soul 
Searchers’ “Ashley’s Roach Clip”, and/or Derek B’s “Rock The Beat (Bonus
 Beats)” (or Cameron Paul’s “Brown Beat”, which is the same as Derek B’s
 “Rock The Beat (Bonus Beats)” but with various James Brown samples 
added to it), Bounce is more of a transparent expression of cultural 
aspects of New Orleans: Secondlines, party music, hood representation, 
call and response, comedy, witty lyrics, roast sessions, dances, chants,
 etc. – a good, ‘hood’ (and sometimes raunchy) cultural celebration.

The first known bounce recording that was distributed to the public was 
DJ Irv’s “Live At Ghosttown” tape which featured a 15-minute version of 
“Where Dey AT?” by MC T Tucker.</span></li></a>

 is a subgenre of Hip Hop which stands for British Hardcore Hip Hop.

The term came up in the early 90’s (from the maker of German hip hop 
magazine MZEE – Ralf Kotthoff) and was adapted by the European scene 
(got mentioned in magazines, on flyers, releases, lyrics).
Two of the earliest releases of that subgenre were ‘Hold No Hostage’ by 
‘Hijack’ and ‘Bring Forth The Guillotine’ by ‘Silver Bullet’, both later
 classified as Britcore.

The majority of crews came from the UK but the main market appeared to 
be the European mainland, especially Germany and Switzerland.
So were some crews releasing their records on German labels towards the 
mid 90’s (Gunshot, Killa Instinct, First Down, Suspekt, Blade).
The Britcore style was adapted by bands from other countries, mainly 
Germany and The Netherlands but there also have been bands in 
Switzerland, Belgium and other European countries, such as Sweden or 
Norway.

The lyrics are mostly in English, even from those crews not being from 
the UK. But there has been a minority of crews rapping in their native 
language, for example in Dutch or German.
In Germany the term Germcore came up but didn’t prevail, although the 
Germans invented their own style and a lot of crews were overproducing 
their beats and rapping on beats up to 165 BPM.

Towards the mid 90’s the support for the scene in the UK decreased and 
to the end of the 90’s the strong Britcore scene on the European 
mainland was nearly not existent anymore.

Due to the internet and the ability to bundle the interest in Britcore 
there has been a little revival of Britcore and old crews revived (new 
releases of Killa Instinct, Dookie Squad, The Criminal Minds, Hideouz 
Newcome, Suspekt to name a few) as well as a few new bands were formed 
and Jams appeared all over Europe.
From back then up to today, Britcore stands for originality, 
unwillingness to compromise and riotousness.

Britcore is way faster than ‘usual’ hip hop, often about 110-130 BPM or 
even faster. It’s mostly based on funk breaks and is using samples from 
movies such as horror movies. The rapping is aggressive and fast (mainly
 male rappers), tongues twisting was used by several MC’s. The lyrics 
were higher-than-average political, sociocritical and often based on the
 movie theme that was used (horror, war etc).
A Britcore groups appearance can be very militant. Also, DJ’s got longer
 parts for scratching (even special styles were created such as 
‘drills’) than on ‘other’ hip hop tunes, a lot of crews had more than 
one DJ (No Remorze, Son Of Noise, Killa Instinct to name a few). At all 
Britcore is way more aggressive, more dark and way faster than other Hip
 Hop.
It’s often overproduced (especially the German stuff) and often very low
 in sound due to the lack of recording-possibilities and the lack of 
money and/or interest from big labels and the music industry. Hardly any
 crews appeared on major labels (Hijack, Caveman, Silver Bullet being 
some of the very few exceptions here), most crews were either on small 
independent labels or used to put out releases on their own, that didn’t
 change up to today. </span></li></a>

 hip hop, or socially conscious hip-hop, is a subgenre of hip hop that 
challenges the dominant cultural, political, philosophical, and economic
 consensus,[4] and/or comments on social issues and conflicts.

Lyrics are used to create consciousness and awareness with the audience.
 Often themes are relating to community, spirituality, economics, and 
politics, sometimes with underlying elements of activism, and on the 
other end, humour. Generally stemming out a desire for positivity, and 
to change the prevailing socio-economic structure. Conscious music seeks
 to inspire its listeners, particularly youth, for positive awareness in
 their lives and the world we share, if not for action, then simply for 
awareness through the dopest music without negative messages. This 
classic American artform stems from the blues with rich detailed 
wordplay about personal growth, determination, and overcoming great 
obstacles, storytelling about injustice, self respect, making mistakes, 
growing, and sharing of knowledge to raise people up.</span></li></a>

 is a subgenre of hip hop music that emerged in the early 1990s and 
gained mainstream success during the mid 2000s. Crunk is often up-tempo 
and one of Southern hip hop’s more dance and club oriented subgenres. An
 archetypal crunk track frequently uses a main groove consisting of 
layered keyboard synths, a drum machine rhythm, heavy basslines, and 
shouting vocals, often in a call and response manner. The term “crunk” 
is also used as a blanket term to denote any style of Southern hip hop, a
 side effect of the genre’s breakthrough to the mainstream. The word 
derives from its African-American slang past-participle form, “crunk”, 
of the verb “to crank” (as in the phrase “crank up”).

Outkast has been attributed as the first artist to use the term in 
mainstream music, in the 1993 track “Player’s Ball”. A seminal year for 
the genre was 1996, with the releases of Three 6 Mafia album Chapter 1: 
The End (featuring “Gette’m Crunk”), and Memphis-based underground hip 
hop artist Tommy Wright III’s album On the Run, which featured the 
Project Pimp track “Getting Crunk”.

Artist Lil Jon was instrumental in bringing the term further into the 
mainstream with his 1997 album titled Get Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album. He
 later released other songs and albums using the term, and has been 
credited by other artists and musicians as galvanizing use of the term 
as well as mainstreaming the music genre itself.

Lil Jon further popularized the word with his 2004 album Crunk Juice, 
and has been credited with inventing the potent alcoholic cocktail by 
that name. This use of “crunk” became synonymous with the meaning “crazy
 drunk”. Non-alcoholic drinks, to which alcohol could be added, were 
manufactured and marketed under the Crunk brand name, with Lil Jon as 
spokesman.

The term has continued to evolve, taking on a negative stigma with 
police, parents and the media. In 2011, the company which manufactured 
“Crunk” drink brought out an alcoholic version named “Crunk Juice”. This
 drink was allegedly marketed towards 19- to 21-year-olds – those under 
the US legal drinking age – resulting in Crunk Juice drinking being 
blamed as a cause of crime or becoming a victim of crime. The mainstream
 media began publishing stories in which the term “crunk” was used to 
refer to “crazy and drunk” criminals.

Crunk music arose from Miami bass music before 1996 in the southern 
United States, particularly in African American strip clubs of Memphis, 
Tennessee. Memphis-based hip hop group Three 6 Mafia were “instrumental 
for the emergence of the crunk style” in the mid-to-late 1990s. Two 
mixtape DJs from Memphis, DJ Paul and Juicy J, started making their 
original music, which was distinctive with its “spare, low-BPM rhythms, 
simplistic chants… and narcotically repetitive, slasher-flick textures”.
 This duo soon became known as Three 6 Mafia. Frequently featuring 
rappers such as Project Pat, Lord Infamous, and Gangsta Boo on their 
releases, they became instrumental in the formation of crunk music.

In 1997, in Atlanta, Lil Jon, with his group The East Side Boyz, 
released their first album titled Get Crunk, Who U Wit. These were the 
first of six albums released by Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz. Lil Jon 
states that they were first to use the word “crunk” in a song hook; he 
claimed that they had started to call themselves a “crunk group” due to 
this album. However, The New York Times denied that Get Crunk, Who Are 
You With was the first crunk album ever. He was one of the key figures 
in popularizing crunk during 1998 and 1999, and produced two gold 
records independently, before signing to TVT Records in 2001. After 
being named the “King of Crunk”, Lil Jon went on to make collaborations 
with many popular artist such as Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Ludacris and 
Britney Spears. Nevertheless, crunk was not exclusively associated with 
Lil Jon and Three 6 Mafia. In its early stages, such artists as Ying 
Yang Twins, White Dawg, Bone Crusher, Lil Scrappy, Trillville, 
Youngbloodz and Pastor Troy from Atlanta, and David Banner from 
Mississippi also helped to popularize crunk music.</span></li></a>

 carioca, favela funk, and in other parts in the world, baile funk, is a
 music genre from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil derived from Miami bass and 
gangsta rap music, which emerged in the mid-eighties.

“Baile funk”, in Brazil, refers not to the music, but to the actual 
parties or discothèques in which the music is played. Although 
originated in Rio, favela funk has become increasingly popular amongst 
working classes in other parts of Brazil. In the whole country, funk 
carioca is most often simply known as funk, although it is very

 or gangsta-funk, is a subgenre of hip hop music that emerged from West 
Coast Gangsta rap in the early 1990s, heavily influenced by 1970s funk 
sound of artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic.

Originating in Los Angeles, California in the early nineties, G-funk 
(which uses funk with an artificially altered tempo) incorporates 
multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep 
bass, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, 
and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. The lyrical 
content depended on the artist and could consist of sex, drugs, 
violence, vandalism and women, but also of love for a city, love for 
friends and relaxing words. There was also a slurred “lazy” or “smooth” 
way of rapping in order to clarify words and stay in rhythmic cadence.

Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as 
EPMD and The Bomb Squad), G-funk often utilized fewer, unaltered samples
 per song. Music theorist Adam Krims has described G-funk as “a style of
 generally West Coast rap whose musical tracks tend to deploy live 
instrumentation, heavy on bass and keyboards, with minimal (sometimes 
no) sampling and often highly conventional harmonic progressions and 
harmonies”. Dr. Dre, a pioneer of the G-funk genre, normally uses live 
musicians to replay the original music of sampled records. This enabled 
him to produce music that had his own sounds, rather than a direct copy 
of the sample</span></li></a>

 is a musical style from Ghana (West Africa) that fuses Ghanaian 
highlife music with hip hop. Recorded predominantly in the Ghanaian Akan
 language, hiplife gainined popularity throughout West Africa and 
abroad, especially in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and the
 Netherlands, where the Ghanaian diaspora can be found.

Highlife music evolved in the seventies and early eighties, when people 
began fusing traditional Akan folk music with Western pop-music, using 
Western instruments. The further evolution of the sound came in the late
 eighties/early nineties, when producers such as Jay Q, Zapp Mallet and 
Chief G began to incorporate Ghanaian highlife music into their 
production, thus creating the sound known as hiplife today. Rapper/MC 
Reggie Rockstone is widely considered the Godfather and originator of 
the hiplife sound.</span></li></a>

rapper Keak da Sneak.

Originating the San Francisco Bay Area, California in the late nineties.
  It is distinguished by gritty, pounding rhythms, and has been compared
 to crunk music. An individual is said to “get hyphy” when they dance in
 an overstated, fast-paced and ridiculous manner, or if they get 
overloud with other people. The phrase “to get hyphy” is similar to the 
southern phrase “to get crunk”. Those who consider themselves part of 
the hyphy movement strive for this behavior.

Ghost riding, frequently used in the context of “ghost riding the whip” 
(a “whip” being a vehicle) or simply ghostin’, is when a person exits 
their moving vehicle, and dances beside and around it. Originating in 
Northern California, specifically the Bay Area, the act is commonly 
related to the culture surrounding the Hyphy movement.</span></li></a>

 hip hop is hip hop music without vocals. Hip hop as a general rule 
consists of two elements: an instrumental track (the “beat”) and a vocal
 track (the “rap”). The artist who crafts the beat is the producer (or 
beatmaker), and the one who crafts the rap is the MC (emcee). In this 
format, the rap is almost always the primary focus of the song, 
providing most of the complexity and variation over a fairly repetitive 
beat. Instrumental hip hop is hip hop music without an emcee rapping. 
This format gives the producer the flexibility to create more complex, 
richly detailed and varied instrumentals. Songs of this genre may wander
 off in different musical directions and explore various subgenres, 
because the instruments do not have to supply a steady beat for an MC. 
Although producers have made and released hip hop beats without MCs 
since hip hop’s inception, those records rarely became well-known. Jazz 
keyboardist/composer Herbie Hancock and bassist/producer Bill Laswell’s 
electro-inspired collaborations are notable exceptions. 1983’s Future 
Shock album and hit single “Rockit” featured turntablist Grand Mixer 
D.ST, the first use of turntables in jazz fusion, and gave the 
turntablism and record “scratching” widespread exposure. The Mix-Up is 
the seventh studio album by the Beastie Boys, released in 2007. The 
album consists entirely of instrumental performances and won a Grammy 
Award in 2008 for Best Pop Instrumental Album.

The release of DJ Shadow’s debut album Endtroducing….. in 1996 saw the 
beginnings of a movement in instrumental hip hop. Relying mainly on a 
combination of sampled funk, hip hop, and film score, DJ Shadow’s 
innovative sample arrangements influenced many producers and musicians.

In the 2000s and 2010s, artists such as RJD2, J Dilla, Pete Rock, Large 
Professor, MF Doom, Danny!, Nujabes, Madlib, Wax Tailor, Denver Kajanga,
 DJ Krush, Hermitude, and Blockhead have garnered critical attention 
with instrumental hip hop albums. Due to the current state of copyright 
law, most instrumental hip-hop releases are released on small, 
independent labels. Producers often have difficulty obtaining clearance 
for the many samples found throughout their work, and labels such as 
Stones Throw are fraught with legal problems.</span></li></a>

 is a genre of music fusing the rhythm-based lyricism of hip hop music 
with pop music’s preference for melodious vocals and catchy tunes, which
 gained mainstream popularity during the 1990s. The lyrics are often 
lighthearted, with choruses similar to those heard in pop music. The 
influences and roots of pop rap trace back to late 1980s hip hop 
artists, such as Run DMC, LL Cool J, and Beastie Boys.

In the 1980s, rap artists including Run DMC, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J 
set up the blueprints and origins of pop-rap as they suddenly broke into
 the mainstream. LL Cool J has been described as the very first 
“pop-rapper” in history, when he rose to prominence on his 1985 debut 
album Radio. MTV has described LL Cool J’s 1987 single “I Need Love,” as
 “one of the first pop-rap crossover hits”. Later, rap artists such as 
Tone Loc, Young MC, and Fresh Prince then made songs with lots of party 
tunes and storytelling abilities as they became very popular. During the
 1990s, pop rap began to expand even more as hip hop music also began to
 connect strongly with dance music and R&amp;B.

In the early 1990s, MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice broke into the mainstream 
with songs like “U Can’t Touch This” and “Ice Ice Baby”, respectively. 
They caused pop-rap to be “derided (and, occasionally, taken to court) 
for its willingness to borrow” from well-known hit singles. By the end 
of the 1990s and early 2000s rappers such as Ja Rule fused gangsta rap 
themes with 1980s pop and soul elements; pop-rap was dominated by many 
artists.

During the early 2000s, pop-rap returned with a whole different style. 
It then went back into the mainstream with the success of The Black Eyed
 Peas who had smash singles such as “Where Is the Love?” which came off 
their Elephunk album. During the late 2000s, pop-rap had many artists 
such as Drake, will.i.am, Nicki Minaj and Wiz Khalifa emerge.</span></li></a>

 and screwed (very rarely also called screwed and chopped or slowed and 
throwed), is a technique of remixing hip hop music which developed in 
the Houston hip hop scene in the early 1990s. This is accomplished by 
slowing the tempo down to between 60 and 70 quarter-note beats per 
minute and applying techniques such as skipping beats, record 
scratching, stop-time, and affecting portions of the music to make a 
“chopped-up” version of the original.

DJ Screw is largely recognized as the innovator behind the chopped and 
screwed genre. DJ Screw’s key technique involved playing the same record
 on both turntables with a delay between them of one beat and quickly 
moving the crossfader side to side. This created an effect where the 
words or beats in a song were repeated without interrupting its tempo.

In Houston, a different approach of slowing music down, rather than 
speeding it up, developed. It is unknown when DJ Screw definitively 
created “screwed and chopped” music: Screw said he started slowing music
 down in 1990 and also in Tulsa, Oklahoma, DJ Dinero And DJ Z-Nasty 
helped popularize chopped and screwed music in the Mid South. There is 
no debate, however, that DJ Screw invented the music style.” He 
discovered that dramatically reducing the pitch of a record gave a 
mellow, heavy sound that emphasized lyrics to the point of almost 
storytelling. After messing around with the sound for a while Screw 
started making full length “Screw Tapes”. At first the music was only 
referred to as “screw music”, was limited to the South Side of Houston, 
and was seen as laid-back driving music. As Screw’s tapes started to 
gain popularity he started selling his tapes for around $10. Screw was 
known to feature some of Houston’s most renowned rappers from the South 
Side. This eventually led to the formation of the Screwed Up Click.

Between 1991 and 1992, there was a large increase in use of purple drank
 in Houston. Purple drank has been considered to be a major influence in
 the making of and listening to chopped and screwed music due to its 
perceived effect of slowing the brain down, giving slow, mellow music 
its appeal. DJ Screw, however, repeatedly denounced the claim that one 
has to use purple drank to enjoy screwed and chopped music. Screw, a 
known user of purple drank, said he came up with chopped and screwed 
music when high on marijuana. Purple drank was very popular in Houston 
because of two factors; a lot of strict drug laws in Texas kept the more
 popular drugs like cocaine and marijuana from crossing state lines 
which spared Houston the worst effects of the crack epidemic, and the 
cheap availability of cough syrup in supermarkets in the 1980s.

In the mid-1990s, chopped and screwed music started to move to the north
 side of Houston by way of DJ Michael “5000” Watts, and later OG RON C. 
It wasn’t long until a rivalry between north and south Houston started 
over who were the “originators” and who were the “adopters”. Michael 
“5000” Watts always gave credit to DJ Screw as the originator of chopped
 and screwed music, which is he calls the genre “screwed and chopped”. 
In the late 1990s, with the help of P2P groups such as Napster, chopped 
and screwed music spread to a much wider audience.</span></li></a>

 started in the early 2000s, and it was much closer to standard hip hop 
than the trap we know today. The only main difference between the two at
 this time is that trap music had different lyrical content. Trap was 
about creating and selling crack cocaine in a home dedicated to the 
cooking/selling of crack cocaine, which was known as a trap. It still 
used the same sampling techniques, but as time went on, producers 
started making the bass heavier and heavier. Important artists from this
 time include Young Jeezy, T.I., and Gucci Mane. The breaking point was 
when the big producers of Atlanta (Zaytoven, Shawty Redd, etc) started 
to lengthen the release of an 808 drum machine kick, which when played 
on speakers that could play low frequencies, made for very heavy bass. 
They then started using this lengthened 808 kick as a bassline, creating
 the backbone of modern trap music. The quickly timed and constantly 
changing rhythm hi hat patterns followed. during this change, the 
instrumentation started to abandon traditional hip hop stylings, and 
move towards a less sample based, more instrument based production. The 
producers started relying heavily on strings and brass to create this 
new heavy sound. Eventually, each producer would find their own sound, 
making trap a very diverse genre. Over time, trap has become very 
experimental, leading to the many different styles we see today.</span></li></a>

 is the art of manipulating sounds and creating new music, sound 
effects, mixes and other creative sounds and beats, typically by using 
two or more turntables and a cross fader-equipped DJ mixer. The mixer is
 plugged into a PA system for live events and/or broadcasting equipment 
(if the DJ is performing on radio, TV or Internet radio) so that a wider
 audience can hear the turntablist’s music. Turntablists manipulate 
records on a turntable by moving the record with their hand to cue the 
stylus to exact points on a record, and by touching or moving the 
platter or record to stop, slow down, speed up or, spin the record 
backwards, or moving the turntable platter back and forth (the popular 
rhythmic “scratching” effect which is a key part of hip hop music), all 
while using a DJ mixer’s crossfader control and the mixer’s gain and 
equalization controls to adjust the sound and level of each turntable. 
Turntablists typically use two or more turntables and headphones to cue 
up desired start points on different records.

Turntablists, who are often called DJs (or “deejays”), generally prefer 
direct-drive turntables over belt-driven or other types, because the 
belt can be stretched or damaged by “scratching” and other turntable 
manipulation such as slowing down a record, whereas a direct drive 
turntable can be stopped, slowed down, or spun backwards without 
damaging the electric motor. The word turntablist was originated by Luis
 “DJ Disk” Quintanilla (Primus, Herbie Hancock, Invisibl Skratch Piklz).
 After a phone conversation with Disk, it was later popularised in 1995 
by DJ Babu to describe the difference between a DJ who simply plays and 
mixes records and one who performs by physically manipulating the 
records, stylus, turntables, turntable speed controls and mixer to 
produce new sounds. The new term coincided with the resurgence of 
hip-hop DJing in the 1990s.

John Oswald described the art: “A phonograph in the hands of a 
‘hiphop/scratch’ artist who plays a record like an electronic washboard 
with a phonographic needle as a plectrum, produces sounds which are 
unique and not reproduced—the record player becomes a musical 
instrument.” Some turntablists use turntable techniques like beat 
mixing/matching, scratching, and beat juggling. Some turntablists seek

 jazz is the earliest form of Latin jazz. It mixes Afro-Cuban 
clave-based rhythms with jazz harmonies and techniques of improvisation.

Afro-Cuban jazz first emerged in the early 1940s with the Cuban 
musicians Mario Bauzá and Frank Grillo “Machito” in the band Machito and
 his Afro-Cubans, based in New York City. In 1947, the collaborations of
 bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie with Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo 
brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, most notably the tumbadora 
and the bongo, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of 
jazz with Cuban music, such as Dizzy’s and Pozo’s “Manteca” and Charlie 
Parker’s and Machito’s “Mangó Mangüé”, were commonly referred to as 
“Cubop”, short for Cuban bebop.[1] During its first decades, the 
Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba 
itself.[2]

In the early 1970s, the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna and later 
Irakere brought Afro-Cuban jazz into the Cuban music scene, influencing 
new styles such as songo.</span></li></a>

 jazz is a style of music and improvisation that combines avant-garde 
art music and composition with jazz. It originated in the mid- to late 
1950s among a group of improvisors who rejected the conventions of bebop
 and post bop in an effort to blur the division between the written and 
the spontaneous. It came to be applied to music differing from free 
jazz, emphasizing structure and organization by the use of composed 
melodies, shifting but nevertheless predetermined meters and tonalities,
 and distinctions between soloists and accompaniment. Musicians 
identified with this early stage of the style include Cecil Taylor, 
Lennie Tristano, Jimmy Giuffre, Sun Ra, and Ornette Coleman.

Originally synonymous with free jazz, much avant-garde jazz was distinct
 from that style.

 be used to describe recordings by a large orchestra which feature brass
 sections with multiple trumpets and trombones and a large reed section.
 A feature is that whole sections (the brass, the reeds) often play some
 parts of the tune in unison while leaving room for soloists at certain 
times. This style of orchestra began to be developed in the early 1920s 
by prominent dance band leaders such as Paul Whiteman and Fletcher 
Henderson, but the majority of 1920s dance bands were smaller groups and
 did not play in the “big band” style. It was not until 1929/30 or so 
that the majority of dance bands adopted this configuration (examples 
are the Casa Loma Orchestra, Mills Blue Rhthm Band, Duke Ellington’s 
Orchestra) and big bands became the norm from the mid-1930s onwards. 
This style should be use sparingly before about 1930 as while there were
 other orchestras recorded similar to those led by Whiteman and 
Henderson (already mentioned) the majority of 1920s dance bands are not 
“big bands”. From the 1930s onwards this style can be applied to 
recordings by any large orchestra. There were both jazz big bands (such 
as Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Jimmy Lunceford, Count 
Basie, etc.) and “sweet” big bands (such as Freddy Martin, Sammy Kaye, 
and Guy Lombardo’s Royal Canadians). This style is often linked to the 
“swing” style (as in “big bands of the swing era”) but it is better to 
avoid use the big band and swing tags together as they do not mean 
exactly the same thing. In reality not all swing groups were big bands, 
and some big bands featured small groups made up of star musicians from 
the larger orchestra (Benny Goodman Trio/Quartet/Sextet, Tommy Dorsey’s 
Clambake Seven, Artie Shaw’s Gramercy Five, etc.) and it is these 
smaller groups which played in the “swing” style. A useful distinction 
is that big band recordings feature large amounts of section work 
(notably the brass and/or the reeds) while smaller “swing” groups were 
more about featured soloists backed by a rhythm section. The big band 
style was most  prominent during the 1930s and 1940s but was still very 
popular up into the 1950s and many big band style recordings continued 
to be made during the 1960s and later.</span></li></a>

 Contemporary Jazz is essentially a catch-all term for the various 
permutations of popular, mainstream jazz of the 1980s and ’90s. While 
those years were certainly not devoid of complex, cerebral jazz 
recordings, music referred to as contemporary jazz does not usually 
share those sensibilities, nor is the term generally used to describe 
music centered around hard bop or the avant-garde. Instead, instrumental
 contemporary jazz is usually informed by some combination of a) fusion —
 often slickly produced, with an emphasis on rock and funk rhythms; b) 
pop-jazz, with its almost exclusive concentration on memorable melodies;
 c) smooth jazz, with its primary goal of creating pleasant, mellow 
textures; and d) crossover jazz and contemporary funk, with their blend 
of polished production and R&amp;B influences. Not all contemporary jazz
 artists completely discard improvisation and challenging 
experimentation, but by and large, most instrumentalists emphasize shiny
 production, melody, and accessibility. In the realm of vocal jazz, 
artists may or may not possess an improvisational flair, but in most 
cases, their recordings attempt to evoke an aura of stylish 
sophistication, sometimes drawing upon pop and R&amp;B in addition to 
jazz. Taken from Allmusic.com style page.</span></li></a>

 improvisation is improvised music without any rules beyond the logic or
 inclination of the musician(s) involved. The term can refer to both a 
technique (employed by any musician in any genre) and as a recognizable 
genre in its own right.
## History
Free improvisation, as a genre of music, developed in the U.S. and 
Europe in the mid to late 1960s. The musical advancements made through 
improvisation through Free Jazz served as inspiration to European 
musicians, who then created “Free Improvisation” as a differentiation. 
Exponents of free improvised music include saxophonists Evan Parker, 
Anthony Braxton, Peter Brötzmann and John Zorn, drummer Christian 
Lillinger, trombonist George Lewis, guitarists Derek Bailey, Henry 
Kaiser and Fred Frith and the improvising groups Spontaneous Music 
Ensemble, The Art Ensemble of Chicago and AMM.
## Characteristics
In an atonal context, free improvisation refers to where the focus 
shifts from harmony to other dimensions of music: timbre, melodic 
intervals, rhythm and the spontaneous interaction between musicians. 
Although performers may choose to play in a certain style or key, or at a
 certain tempo, conventional songs are highly uncommon in free 
improvisation; more emphasis is generally placed on mood, texture or 
more simply, on performative gesture than on preset forms of melody, 
harmony or rhythm. These elements are improvised at will, as the music 
progresses.

At the same time, Free Improvisation is a problematic term. It is 
neither free nor improvised as in their strict definitions. Musicians 
who play free improvisation develop highly individualized musical 
vocabulary which are then played without the restriction of a score. In 
this sense, the freedom implied by the term Free Improvisation is more 
of an aesthetic of playing towards notions of freedom than freedom in 
the pure sense.

As it has influenced and been influenced by other areas of exploration, 
aspects of modern classical music (extended techniques), noise rock 
(aggressive confrontation and dissonance), IDM (computer manipulation 
and digital synthesis), minimalism and electroacoustic music can now be 
heard in free improvisation.

 jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s
 and 1960s. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a 
common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard 
bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Free jazz
 musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, 
often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. While usually 
considered avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt 
to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on 
collective improvisation.

Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of Ornette 
Coleman and Cecil Taylor and the later works of saxophonist John 
Coltrane. Other important pioneers include Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, 
Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Joe Maneri and Sun Ra. Coleman pioneered 
many techniques typical of free jazz, most notably his rejection of 
pre-written chord changes, believing instead that freely improvised 
melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression in his 
compositions. Some of bassist Charles Mingus’s work was also important 
in establishing free jazz.

Typically this kind of music is played by small groups of musicians, 
although some examples use larger numbers. Other forms of jazz use clear
 regular meters and strongly pulsed rhythms. Free jazz normally retains a
 general pulsation but without regular meter, and we encounter frequent 
accelerando and ritardando, giving an impression of the rhythm moving in
 waves. Previous jazz forms used harmonic structures (usually cycles of 
diatonic chords). Free jazz almost by definition is free of such 
structures, but also by definition (it is, after all, “jazz” as much as 
it is “free”) it retains much of the language of earlier jazz playing.

 (sometimes spelled rag-time or rag time) is a musical style that 
enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1919. Its cardinal trait is
 its syncopated or “ragged” rhythm. Wikipedia

Originally developed in the U.S. in the late 19th century by various 
composers of whom one of he best known is Scott Joplin (whose most 
famous work is “Maple Leaf Rag”). In it’s earliest period ragtime was 
also associated with the cakewalk (a dance). After 1900 the ragtime 
style became very popular worldwide and there are many recordings of 
ragtime from the UK, Europe and elsewhere in the period before 1920 (but
 mostly before WWI).

Ragtime, while an obvious precursor of jazz, is a written [ie. composed]
 music rather than an improvised form of music. Despite sharing the 
syncopated base that was an essential element in later jazz, ragtime was
 performed as written and had a strict form (usually with an “A” section
 followed by a “B” section and then a return to the “A” section – or 
some variation of this) and was often played by military or brass bands.
 During it’s peak period (before 1920) most ragtime recordings are by 
orchestras or bands or are vocal recordings of ragtime songs. Ragtime 
recordings can frequently (but not always) be identified by the use of 
the word rag or ragtime in the title.

Although rags continued to be recorded in the period from 1920s to the 
1940s, ragtime was no longer a common form during this period as jazz 
and later big bands or swing had became dominant. The ragtime tag should
 be used very sparingly after 1919. It should NOT be applied to any 
early jazz or popular music records unless the titles are specifically 
ragtime compositions. Just having a rhythmic or syncopated sound does 
not make a record ragtime and jazz or pop (or both) would be more 
appropriate.

During the 1920s &amp; 1930s many recordings of novelty syncopated piano
 solos were made by artists such as Zez Confrey, Roy Bargy &amp; Rube 
Bloom (in the U.S.) and many others worldwide including Billy Mayerl 
&amp; Raie Da Costa (in the UK), Willie Eckstein (in Canada), Jean 
Wiener &amp; Clement Doucet (in France), Mischa Spoliansky (in Germany),
 or Gil Dech &amp; Beryl Newell (in Australia). While obviously 
influenced by ragtime these are not ragtime recordings and should be 
given the pop tag.

The ragtime influence on jazz was very significant and some early jazz 
performers (such as Jelly Roll Morton) both wrote and recorded rags. 
Some jazz pianists were more ragtime influenced than others with James 
P. Johnson and Thomas Waller (later better known as Fats Waller) 
recording in what is known as the stride style, while other jazz piansts
 such as Earl Hines and Duke Ellington created totally new styles of 
jazz piano. The ragtime tag does not aply to these or other similar jazz
 records.

By the 1950s interest in the ragtime style was re-emerging and there was
 something of a revival with many ragtime compositions being recorded 
(and some new ones written and recorded). An off-shoot of the ragtime 
revival was Honky-tonk which is not strictly ragtime and is more 
appropriately tagged pop.

Ragtime is a very well defined style and the tag should not be applied 
broadly unless it is a ragtime composition from the peak peak 
(1895-1919) or a ragtime composition recorded later. If jazz, pop or 
some other tag is applicable this should be preferred.</span></li></a>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220810095106/https://www.discogs.com/style/swing" onclick="javascript:window.open('https://www.discogs.com/style/swing'); return false;"><li class="gsl-release"><span class="gsl-artist">Swing</span><span class="gsl-title">89,135 Releases</span><span class="gsl-label">The
 swing style developed in the 1930s and should not be used for earlier 
records such as 1920s jazz. While the swing style has its roots in the 
1920s as jazz developed due to the emergence of musicians such as Lous 
Armstrong, it took some time for the many different regional jazz styles
 typical of the 1920s to evolve into the more unified and sophisticated 
style known as swing. Eventually the “swing craze” of the mid-1930s when
 big bands like Benny Goodman became hugely popular with younger dancers
 brought jazz into the mainstream. It is from this period onwards that 
the swing style can be applied to many jazz records and while opinions 
about how to define swing obviously vary, it is most typified by the 
many jazz small groups that recorded from the 1930s onwards (examples 
are Fats Waller &amp; His Rhythm, Wing Manone’s Orchestra, Lionel 
Hampton’s Orchestra, and the many records by the Benny Goodman 
Trio/Quartet/Sextet). The swing style began in the U.S. but was quickly 
adopted by musicians worldwide who made recordings in their own 
countries (UK examples would be Joe Daniels &amp; His Hot Shots or Nat 
Gonella &amp; His Georgians).

Although many members of the small swing groups worked in big bands, the
 two styles are distinct. By definition a big band was a large orchestra
 of at least 12 musicians (and often larger), while a typical swing 
group of the 1930s was usually a trio, quartet or sextet and most swing 
recording groups were by at most 7 or 8 musicians. A useful distinction 
is that a big band featured soloists in the context of tight 
arrangements using whole sections of the orchestra such as the brass or 
reeds (seperately or together) while a swing group was more oriented to 
featuring the musicians as soloists with the backing of a rhythm section
 only. Of course in some cases big band recordings featured soloists 
extensively, while small band swing records sometimes featured section 
work as well as solos – so there is not always a clear distinction. 
However, the swing tag is most usefully applied to recordings which 
feature one or more jazz soloists extensively (especially in a small 
group context).

The swing style was most popular during the 1930s and 1940s, but swing 
style recordings continued to be made well after that period. Mosty 
swing is associated with insttumental recordings (although some small 
band swing records also featuted vocals) however from the 1940s onwards 
the role of jazz or jazz-influenced singers became more dominant and 
swing can in some cases also be associated with recordings by pop 
vocalists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole.

As early as the 1930s swing blended with other genres to create new 
music styles. In country music, artists such as Bob Wills introduced 
many elements of swing along with blues to create a genre called Western
 Swing. In the blues style there were groups which added elements of 
swing in their recordings such as the Harlem Hamfats. Gypsy Jazz is a 
style based on the string jazz of Venuti and Lang’s recordings. Swing 
revivals have occurred periodically from the late 1960s to the 2000s. In
 the late-1980s (into the early 1990s) a trendier, more urban-styled 
swing-beat emerged called New Jack Swing, spearheaded by Teddy Riley. In
 the late 1990s and into the 2000s there was a swing revival, led by 
Squirrel Nut Zippers, Brian Setzer, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and Lavay 
Smith.</span></li></a>

 is an Uruguayan music and dance style that comes from African slaves. 
It is considered an important aspect of the culture of Uruguay and was 
recognized by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage of humanity.

This Uruguayan music style is based on three different drums: chico, 
repique and piano drums. This music style is usually played in February 
during carnival in Montevideo, Uruguay at dance parades called 
“Llamadas” and “Desfile Innaugural del Carnaval”. In the late 1960s and 
early 1970s candombe was mixed with elements from 60s pop music and 
bossa nova to create a new genre called candombe beat. The origin of 
this genre was largely said to be the work of Eduardo Mateo, a Uruguayan
 singer, songwriter and musician. This style was later adopted by Jaime 
Roos and Ruben Rada, as well as several Montevideo-based bands that 
further mixed it with rock.

To a lesser extent, Candombe is practiced in Argentina, Paraguay and 
Brazil. In Argentina, it can be found in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Paraná,
 and Corrientes. In Paraguay this tradition is continued in Kamba Kua 
(Camba Cua), an Afro-Paraguayan community in Fernando de la Mora near 
Asuncion. Also, in Brazil, it still retains its religious character and 
can be found in Minas Gerais State. </span></li></a>

 conjunto music, also known as conjunto tejano, was born in south Texas 
at the end of the 19th century, after German settlers introduced the 
button accordion. The bajo sexto has come to accompany the button 
accordion and is integral to the conjunto sound. Many conjuntos are 
concentrated in the Southwestern portion of the United States, primarily
 in Texas and California. In Mexico the term conjunto is associated with
 norteño and tejano music. Since tejano was bred out of norteño music 
originally this association is not entirely false. However, due to 
various cultural and socioeconomic developments in the 1900s, norteño 
musicians began trailblazing the tejano genre as a tangent to conjunto.

In the United States and Mexico, a conjunto band is composed of four 
main instruments: the button accordion, the bajo sexto, an electric 
bass, and a drum kit. They are popular in northern Mexico and southern 
Texas. German and East European settlers brought their accordions, 
waltzes and polkas to the region, which were adapted by the local 
population. Texas accordion player Flaco Jiménez is probably the 
best-known conjunto musician in the United States, with a career 
spanning sixty years and earning him six Grammy awards. “Chulas 
Fronteras” is a documentary film from the 1970s which illustrates how 
the music meshed into the lives of families in south Texas and northern 
Mexico.

 Gaita Zuliana is an original musical genre from the Zulia state in 
Venezuela, declared Heritage of Cultural and Artistic Interest of 
Venezuela, in some regions of Venezuela and in the communities of 
Venezuelans around the world it’s related to Christmas, but nowadays 
it’s a genre that runs throughout the year.

 It’s most famous interpreters are Gran Coquivacoa, Guaco and Maracaibo 
15, and the topics covered by this genre range from songs to love and 
religious figures to humorous themes and denunciations. The political 
element is also the protagonist of many issues.

It was executed initially with cuatro, furro, tambora, charrasca and 
maracas. Soon they added the bass, the piano, the electric guitar, the 
congas, the bongo, the cowbell and even brass (trumpet, trombone and 
saxophone) and drums.

Although the Gaita was born as a folkloric expression, it’s evolution 
became at the beginning of the 70’s a Latin style influenced by 
Caribbean music, especially salsa and merengue. Most of the Gaita music 
that was recorded can be registered in the Latin genre.

 Carnavalesca, also called “Marchinha de Carnaval” or simply “Marchinha”
 is one of several genres of music typical of urban Carnival in 
southeast region of Brazil.

Regularly played by a solo vocalist or choir accompanied by a band of 
brass and percussion, the lyrics / themes were mostly comic, satirical 
and spicy, ironizing the conservative behavior and politics of everyday 
life.

Initially composed to be played and sung in the carnival blocks that 
paraded through the streets of the cities, they were adopted as 
soundtracks for the carnival balls in closed halls, called “Bailes de 
Carnaval”.

Because of the simplicity of the lyrics, almost always in one or two 
verses and chorus, most of the recordings were made in the form of 
medleys, grouping several songs into few tracks, as played on the balls.

The first Marchinha was the composition (in 1899) of Chiquinha Gonzaga 
entitled “O Abre Alas,” made to the Cordão Carnavalesco “Rosa de Outro.”

The most famous song in style is “Cidade Maravilhosa,” the official 
anthem of Rio de Janeiro, composed in 1934 by André Filho.</span></li></a>

 Criolla or Canción Criolla is a varied genre of Peruvian music that 
exhibits influences from African, European, and Andean music. The 
genre’s name reflects the coastal culture of Peru, and the local 
evolution of the term criollo into a more socially inclusive element of 
the nation.

Afro-Peruvian music was first created by African slaves in Peru during 
the Colonial Period and beyond. The rhythms include Festejo, Landó, 
Socabon, Pregon, Zamacueca, and Alcatraz. Many of those were played with
 a mixture of Spanish and Indian instruments and used the Spanish coplas
 as lyrics. They were practiced only in private black gatherings until 
the 1950s, when efforts of some scholars studying the Peruvian 
community, such as Lucha Reyes, Nicomedes Santa Cruz, Victoria Santa 
Cruz and Jose Durand, compiled songs and dances after struggling with 
racism and poor recognition. Interpreters such as Lucila Campos, Caitro 
Soto, Susana Baca, Eva Ayllon, and the Peru Negro dance company, among 
others, have brought these genres to the world’s attention.

The most popular dance themed movement of música criolla in Perú is the 
marinera, often called the national dance of Perú. Other main dance 
themed movements are the Peruvian vals and tondero, festejo, polka, 
zamacueca, coplas de amor fino, and landó. Peru’s national Día de la 
Canción Criolla takes place on October 31.

 Nueva Canción Chilena or “New Chilean Song” was a movement and genre of
 Chilean traditional and folk music incorporating strong political and 
social themes. The movement was to spread throughout Latin America 
during the 1960s and 1970s, in what is called “Nueva canción” sparking a
 renewal in traditional folk music and playing a key role in political 
movements in the region.

The foundations of the Chilean New Song were laid through the efforts of
 Violeta Parra to revive over 3,000 Chilean songs, recipes, traditions, 
and proverbs, and it eventually aligned with the 1970 presidential 
campaign of Salvador Allende, incorporating the songs of Víctor Jara, 
Inti-Illimani and Quilapayun among others.

Other key proponents of the movement include Patricio Manns, Rolando 
Alarcón, Payo Grondona, Patricio Castillo, Homero Caro, and Kiko 
Álvarez, as well as non-Chilean musicians, such as César Isella and 
Atahualpa Yupanqui from Argentina and Paco Ibañéz of Spain.</span></li></a>

the Spanish-based coros de clave.

Traditionally performed by poor workers of African descent in streets 
and solares (courtyards), rumba remains one of Cuba’s most 
characteristic forms of music and dance. Vocal improvisation, elaborate 
dancing and polyrhythmic drumming are the key components of all rumba 
styles. Cajones (wooden boxes) were used as drums until the early 20th

 which was also developed in New York City, has had a significant

referred to as “The Queen of Tejano”, Mazz, Elida Reyna, Los Palominos, 
Ramón Ayala, Elsa García, Laura Canales, La Mafia, Oscar Estrada, Jay 
Perez, Emilio Navaira, Alicia Villarreal, Gary Hobbs, Shelly Lares, 
Stefani Montiel, David Lee Garza and Jennifer Peña, La Fiebre La Sombra.

**Origins**

Europeans from Germany (first during Spanish time and 1830s), Poland, 
and what is now the Czech Republic migrated to Texas and Mexico, 
bringing with them their style of music and dance. They brought with 
them the waltz, polkas and other popular forms of music and dance. 
However it was not until the Mexican Revolution (1910–1917) that forced 
many of these Europeans to flee Mexico and into South Texas, that their 
musical influence was to have a major impact on Tejanos.

At the turn of the century, Tejanos were mostly involved in ranching and
 agriculture. The only diversion was the occasional traveling musician 
who would come to the ranches and farms. Their basic instruments were 
the flute, guitar, and drum, and they sang songs that were passed down 
through the generations from songs originally sung in Mexico. One of 
these musicians was Lydia Mendoza, who became one of the first to record
 Spanish language music as part of RCA’s expansion of their popular race
 records of the 1920s. As these traveling musicos traveled into areas 
where the Germans, Poles, and Czechs lived, they began to incorporate 
the oom-pah sound into their music. Narciso “El Huracan del Valle” 
Martinez, known as the father of conjunto music, defined the accordion’s
 role in conjunto music.

Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of 
traditional forms such as the corrido and mariachi, and Continental 
European styles, such as polka, introduced by German and Czech settlers 
in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by 
Tejano folk musicians at the turn of the 20th century, and it became a 
popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico. 
Small bands known as orquestas, featuring amateur musicians, became a 
staple at community dances.

Norteño/conjunto accordion pioneer Narciso Martínez learned many tunes 
from German and Czech brass bands and transposed them to his accordion. 
Martínez gave accordion playing a new virtuosity in the 1930s, when he 
adopted the two button row accordion. At the same time, he formed a 
group with Santiago Almeida, a bajo sexto player. Their new musical 
style, known as conjunto, soon became the popular music of the working 
class Tejano. Flaco Jiménez carried on Martinez’s tradition of accordion
 virtuosity and became a fixture on the international World Music scene 
by the 1980s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, rock and roll and country music made inroads, 
and electric guitars and drums were added to conjunto combos. Also, 
performers such as Little Joe added both nuances of jazz and R&amp;B, 
and a Chicano political consciousness.  During the 1970s, the music was 
known as “La Onda Chicana;” it was later rebranded as “la Onda Tejana” 
in the late 1980s-90s.

The 1960s and 1970s brought a new fusion of cultures and the first La 
Onda Tejana Broadcasters. Popular Tejano musician and producer Paulino 
Bernal of the Conjunto Bernal discovered and introduced to the Tejano 
music scene the norteño band Los Relampagos Del Norte with Ramon Ayala 
and Cornelio Reyna on his Bego Records. Ayala still enjoys success on 
both sides of the border. Reyna enjoyed a very successful career as an 
actor and singer and resurfaced in the Tejano scene with a major hit 
with his collaboration with Tejano artist La Mafia. He toured constantly
 until his death. In the 1960s and 1970s, the first La Onda Tejana 
broadcasting pioneers hit the airwaves including Marcelo Tafoya (first 
recipient of the Tejano Music Awards “Lifetime Achievement Award), Mary 
Rodriguez, Rosita Ornelas, and Luis Gonzalez, shortly followed by an 
influx of broadcasters including the Davila family of San Antonio. This 
central Texas support by popular broadcasters helped fuel La Onda.

La Onda continued to surge in the early to mid-1980s with the fusion 
progression of tejano music coming to the forefront regionally with 
“tejano ballads” like Espejismo’s hit “Somos Los Dos”, written and sung 
by McAllen native Rudy Valdez, and La Sombra with their Tex-Mex English 
&amp; Spanish brand of tejano. As the 1990s dawned, La Mafia, already 
holding over a dozen Tejano Music Awards, originated a new tejano style 
later to become a tejano standard. La Mafia combined a pop beat to the 
popular Mexican cumbia and achieved success never before seen in the 
tejano industry, becoming the first tejano artist to sell over one 
million albums with Estas Tocando Fuego in 1992. With extensive touring 
from as early as 1988, they eventually opened the doors for such artists
 as Selena, Emilio Navaira, Jay Perez, and Grupo Mazz. Electronic 
instruments and synthesizers increasingly dominated the sound, and 
tejano music increasingly appealed to bilingual country and rock fans. 
In the wake of her murder, Selena’s music received attention from a 
mainstream American audience as well. Selena, known as “Queen of Tejano 
Music”, became the first female tejano artist to win a Grammy and her 
Ven Conmigo became the first tejano album by a female artist certified 
gold.

Since 1998, tejano has seen a decline of dedicated radio stations across
 the USA, due to several factors. Among these is the success of 
Intocable. As a result, many radio stations across the U.S., especially 
in Texas, have converted to Norteño/Banda. This has caused tejano 
internet radio to become popular.

 recording is a style of non-music. Field recordings are audio 
recordings of sounds, often non-musical, but music can be recorded as 
well. Artists of this style typically have zero involvement with the 
sound of the piece, they are simply recording “the field”. Field 
recordings can be of nature (bird songs, rain, the ocean, etc), of 
locations (markets, factories, restaurants, etc), of events (parades, 
family gatherings, etc), and countless other subjects.

Field recordings can also include recordings of electrical systems, 
space noise, and so on. Field recordings can also be musical if the 
subject is of music; but only when the field recorder is recording music
 that they themselves are not involved in. Artists such as [a=Kink Gong]
 are well known for their musical field recordings. If the field 
recorder is involved in the music they are recording, it is no longer a 
field recording, but special exceptions do occur (such as an artist 
field recording themselves playing with toy instruments with their 
child).

An alternate name of field recording is phonography, the sound 
equivalent of photography. In the case of field recordings, typically it
 is of things the artist is not directly involved in. Or if the artist 
is involved it is naturally occurring sounds such as movement, talking, 
eating, and so on. The concept of field recording being “sound 
photography” should help you know when to apply this style tag and when 
to not.</span></li></a>

 songs, more formally known as Hindi film songs or filmi songs, are 
songs featured in Bollywood films. Derived from the song-and-dance 
routines common in Indian films, Bollywood songs, along with dance, are a
 characteristic motif of Hindi cinema which gives it enduring popular 
appeal, cultural value and context.

Linguistically, Bollywood songs tend to use a colloquial dialect of 
Hindi-Urdu, or Hindustani, mutually intelligible to both Hindi and Urdu 
speakers, while modern Bollywood songs also increasingly incorporate 
elements of Hinglish. Urdu poetry has had a particularly strong impact 
on Bollywood songs, where the lyrics draw heavily from Urdu poetry and 
the ghazal tradition.  In addition, Punjabi is also occasionally used 
for Bollywood songs.

Bollywood music covers a variety of styles and covers almost all styles 
of formal music which would include, Rock, Pop, Classical and 
Traditional. Most of the older films’ songs were sung in the Traditional
 Ragas and contributed heavily to its longevity. Today the styles have 
been westernised to cater to the younger audiences, but the traditional 
elements still remain.

Instrumentation-wise, Bollywood music still contain majority of the 
traditional classical instruments like Sitar, Santoor, Tabla etc yet the
 versatility of these instruments also translates very well into the 
western styles of music. Fusion music between western and eastern 
instruments already occurred through the 1950’s and was met with great 
appreciation.

 term Enka (演歌) was originally used to refer political protest songs 
from the late 19th century; however, from the 1960s onwards, it has 
referred to Japanese popular music in a minor key, sung with no 
accompaniment, in a “melisma” style (where a single syllable of text is 
sung while moving between several different notes in succession). In 
Japanese, this vocal style is known as “kobushi”. To put it more simply,
 it means that the pitch of the singer’s voice fluctuates irregularly; 
this compares with vibrato, which vibrates in a perfectly regular cycle.
 Although the kobushi technique is most widely associated with enka, is 
not limited to enka, as it can also be heard in the Italian song “Santa 
Lucia.”

The “kobushi” vocal style developed in the late 1930s, and was 
influenced by Scottish, Irish, Italian and Russian folk melodies, 
chanson and big band, as well as drawing on Japanese musical traditions.
 Koga Masao, a very popular and influential composer primarily active in
 the late 1930s and 40s, began to include Buddhist “shoumyou” chanting 
style vocals into his songs, because his record label asked him to 
produce more popular music; this shoumyou-type vocal is kobushi-like. As
 the nascent genre developed, however, the vocals moved away from 
shoumyou and more towards the “modern” type of kobushi.

The Western music scale has 7 notes, the well-known 
“Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti”, but the native Japanese scale only has 5: 
“Do-Re-Mi-So-La”. For this reason, the Japanese scale can be referred to
 as “ヨナ抜き” (Yona-nuki : “Yo” means 4, “Na” means 7, “Nuki” means 
“without”): it means that notes four and seven in the western scale are 
“removed”.

Throughout the 1950s-1970s, artists like Misora Hibari, Kitajima 
Saburou,  solidified enka’s place in Japanese pop music (sometimes with 
songs that had to be retroactively labelled “enka”), but past the 1970s,
 enka’s market share dropped off significantly, even as notable artists 
continued to make hits in the 80s and beyond.

Often confused for Enka are related genres like “盛り場ポップス” (sakariba pops
 / bar pops) and “ムード歌謡” (mood kayou). Some labels even tried to push 
these (often short-lived) subgenres as a marketing strategy. RCA and 
Nippon Crown were particularly known for this; RCA pushed Fuji Keiko, 
Uchiyamada Hiroshi &amp; his Cool Five, and Kaji Meiko as “enka” 
artists, although strictly speaking, they were singing enka-influenced 
kayoukyoku songs. (Not that most people are particularly bothered.) 
Another similar genre is the nagashi-uta, a subgenre of songs with 
darker themes which is also influenced by traditional Japanese music; 
this made a resurgence with the popularity of folk-rock in the 1960s and
 70s.

Other musically-related kanji that are pronounced “enka” occasionally 
confuse the naive reader as well. “艶歌” means “sexy, bewitching, 
voluptuous” and is occasionally used in easy-listening “pornogroove” 
type kayoukyoku albums (which are often enka-influenced, but usually 
lacking kobushi vocal style, or any vocals at all). “怨歌” is rarely used,
 but it means “resentment song”; the resentment song has very dark or 
negative themes, and is enka-styled, but may or may not fall under the 
formalistic enka umbrella. The “resentment song” was very popular during
 the 60s and 70s as an expression of the rage of Japanese youth against 
the Japan-US Security Treaty and the Vietnam War. A third set of kanji 
is “援歌” or “cheer song”, which is generally enka-like, but sung in an 
upbeat major key and at a faster “marching” style tempo, and often with 
backup singers, like Suizenji Kiyoko’s “三百六十五歩のマーチ”.</span></li></a>

 is not a technical term indicating the structure of music and sound 
style. J-pop is Japanese pop music after Shōwa era (AD 07 Jan 1989).  In
 around 1993 when this term became popular it mainly refers to dance 
music.

“J-pop” is not simply shorthand for “Japanese Pop” – rather, it is a 
term that started to be used around 1990, and has since come to be 
applied to most popular music sung in Japanese using contemporary 
instrumentation and recording techniques, though the term is usually 
applied to more dance-oriented music.

The term was coined by record companies in order to describe the 
changing nature of the Japanese music business, and to replace the older
 terms Kayōkyoku (歌謡曲) and Shōwa Kayō (昭和歌謡) (‘Shōwa’ being the name of 
the era corresponding to the reign of the Shōwa Emperor, 25 Dec 1926 to 
07 Jan 1989).

As the Shōwa era changed to the succeding Heisei era, the Japanese music
 market was at the same moment shifting from vinyl records to CDs as the
 primary music format. This change of era, along with stylistic and 
marketing changes in the Japanese music industry, prompted the need for a
 new term.
After the Shōwa Emperor’s death on January 7, 1989, Most industries in 
Japan have been subject to mourning and refrained from selling. the 
market for popular music — and particularly upbeat danceable music — 
became subdued; this effect lasted well into the summer of 1989, when 
dance tunes gradually made the market active again.

At this time, the Tokyo-based radio station J-Wave popularized the term 
“J-pop” and helped it become widespread.
Although J-wave played only Japanese dance music, it diffused the new 
term “J-pop” and helped promote it in the wider Asian market.
This followed a pattern which began around the same period of using “J” 
to identify Japan and Japanese products, for example, the J-League 
(Japan Professional Football League – 1993), JT (Japan Tobacco – 1985), 
JR (Japan Railways Group- 1987), amongst others.
J-wave diffused a new technical term “J-pop” which a music genre after 
1990. but it was not immediately packaged for their products.

In the feverish climate of the Japanese asset price bubble (1986-1992), 
the Japanese music market made these dance tunes called J-pop a symbol 
of the prosperity of the Japanese economy.
In 1993, Tower Records Japan created a dedicated section in its shops 
for J-pop, and its subsequent popularity cemented the term in common use
 at home and abroad.

The success of genre J-pop has meant that, even now, Japanese major 
record companies tend to abuse the term to sell related Japanese music 
products.  There has been confusion in the market due to the 
ever-expanding scope of the term. Japanese major record companies will 
often label older music “J-pop” to help the sale of back-catalog titles 
(which is becoming an increasingly large part of the market).
This has created resistance amongst people who want Shōwa period music 
to be recognised in its own right, and not incorporated ‘ex post facto’ 
into an amorphous concept of J-pop. That meant a departure from the 
Showa era. It divided people of the Showa era and young dance pop 
fans.Those who rely on Showa’s pop music thereby want to incorporate it 
into J-pop, but that is a mistake.

Japan has a different culture and history than the Western market. the 
Japanese market has big wholesale companies. 星光堂 (Seikodo), WINT 
(日本レコード販売網 JARECS, Lilac trading).
The retailers must go through either wholesale company. If the retailer 
does not pass the wholesale company, the retail store can not purchase 
the record / CD released by the major company. Japanese wholesaler has 
not sales division / category for J-pop in 1989. Naturally Japanese 
major companies did not even have a sales strategy for J-pop for 
retailers. They did not have the technical term J-pop for that. 
Physically J-pop can not exist on products before 1990.
To put it briefly, since the summer of 1989, J-wave spread the 
terminology of J-pop for dance music, However it shared
the ambiguous outline of J-pop in the consciousness of Japanese 
listeners, It was in 1990.

So the concept of J-pop was born after the summer of 1989 that J-wave 
announced “J-pop” for spread immediately in the Asian market. but in 
1993 J-pop products began to spread for sale. J-pop cannot exist on 
original time of the vinyl record release before 1990. J-pop does not 
exist on the vinyl record and tracks of vinyl record era. This sources: 
Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) and Japan Record Commerce
 Association, JASRAC.

The term has spawned similar descriptors K-Pop (Korea) and C-Pop (China)
 or Canto-Pop (Hong Kong)

 often instrumental, light music is also sometimes called concert music 
or mood music. While it originates in the 18th and 19th century, the 
style of light music has been referred to as such since the end of WWII 
and the beginning of the 1950’s. Since then, it has been flourishing as a
 specific style.
Considered to be especially played and appreciated in Western countries 
(Europe, US…), light music is so-called not only for its easy-listening 
side, but also because it is considered as less technical and much more 
accessible to a broader audience than other forms of music such as the 
symphony or the concerto.
Media such as the radio or the television have widely contributed to the
 success of the style, with for instance the BBC broadcasting light 
music on a regular basis in the mid-20th century. Examples of artists 
and composers typical of light music include Franck Pourcel, Percy 
Faith, Mantovani,  Charles Ancliffe, Ronald Binge, Eric Coates, Frederic
 Curzon, Trevor Duncan, Robert Farnon, Adalgiso Ferraris, Ron Goodwin, 
Albert Ketèlbey, Billy Mayerl, Angela Morley, Ernest Tomlinson, Sidney

 is the German word for “Hit”, initially it has the same meaning, a big 
success.
Later “Schlager” became the term for a kind of easy listening pop music,
 trying to please most people as possible in German speaking countries 
and Benelux.

In “Schlager” nearly all kinds of music styles are possible. Songs from 
the musical genres Country, Rock’n’Roll, Pop, Swing (and in few cases 
Hard Rock) counts as Schlager, when the English lyrics are exchanged by 
German or Dutch. Also in the other direction, where a Schlager became 
with English lyrics a pop song. Would the Band ABBA sung their songs in 
German, this music would count as Schlager.
Much Schlagers are from USA, UK, other European countries, especially 
Netherlands, in some cases the German version is more popular, than the 
original.
By the way, German Schlagers were exported, much of the Dutch Schlagers 
are German Schlagers with Dutch Lyrics. Few German Schlagers became 
successfull in the USA.

Some Schlager songs are sentimental. Some Schlager songs refers to 
German folk and German drinking songs. Some Schlager songs are 
arrangements of classical music.

Schlager songs were very popular from the 1920’s till the 1970’s. In 
this time, songs in German language almost counts as Schlager. This 
changed in the 1980’s, where the “New Wave” reached Germany and much 
bands began to sing in German, this was called “Neue Deutsche Welle” and
 was beside singer/songwriters the first German music without the 
“Schlager” label. Germany’s answer to “New Wave” lasts few years, but 
was door opener and encouraging much bands to sing in German. And today 
it’s common, that Germany has much different music in German language 
that isn’t seen as Schlager.

In East Germany it was different. There was the rule “When you want to 
sing on a record, you have to sing German”, so in East Germany was a 
German pop music beside Schlager, long before West-Germany discovered 
this way.

Much Schlagers of today are in the style of electronic Dance music 
“Disco Fox”.

Arrangement and orchestration: Many things are possible, from a small 
band with drums, bass and two guitars to a big orchestra with brass and 
strings. Most songs are sung, most of them by one main singer, some with
 two main singers, often some accompaniment by a choir and in few cases a
 choir as the main singers. In the 1980’s they began to use electronic 
instruments and sequencers more and more frequently.

In the 1970’s, there were TV shows and sampler records containing both, 
German Schlager and English Pop music, this was possible and worked. The
 famous German TV show “hitparade im ZDF” showed the most successful pop
 songs in German language, till the coming of “Neue Deutsche Welle” this
 were Schlagers. It was a show, where the vocal performance had to be 
live, accompanied by tapes with the orchestral backing from the original
 recording. Later they tried to open the show to other music from 
Germany in English language and also the use of full playback, so the 
vocal performance was prerecorded. Few years later, they turned back to 
semi playback and German language. But in the 1990s Schlager wasn’t so 
much popular anymore, so the show “hitparade” wasn’t continued.

At least, Schlager was a collective term for different kinds of pop 
music with German lyrics.</span></li></a>

 nearly all pop music involves sung vocals, in Vocal pop music, there is
 an exceptional emphasis on a virtuosic, solo vocal performance which 
carries almost the entire melody. The backing music is often a 
relatively simple accompaniment by chords in a lower register, although 
it can include lush orchestral or big-band arrangements as well. Rhythm 
sections tend to be very subdued, if present at all.

Record shops and collectors typically use the term Vocal in reference to
 mainstream, “white”, “adult” English-language pop music of the 1950s 
and 1960s: mainly ballads and standards which continue the tradition of 
vocal jazz, without the improvisational elements. The style’s peak 
coincided with the early rock &amp; roll era, after which most Vocal pop
 became regarded as “easy listening” music, but it continues to enjoy 
waves of popularity throughout the world to the present day.

On Discogs, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with the style, the Vocal tag 
is not used so strictly. It is found on all kinds of pop releases from 
all eras, whenever a vocal solo dominates the performance. However, it 
should not be used on just any pop music with vocals. It is 
inappropriate for especially highly rhythmic pop or music which is 
better tagged with a regional style such as Chanson (French-language 
vocal pop) or a style under the Folk, World &amp; Country genre.</span></li></a>

 is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s.
 Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots 
style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. Two of the biggest stars 
of the early dancehall era were Yellowman and Eek-a-Mouse. Dancehall 
brought a new generation of producers, including Linval Thompson, Gussie
 Clarke and Jah Thomas. In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became
 more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall
 (or “ragga”) becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. 
(The word “bashment”, a term originating in the 1990s, was used to 
describe a particularly good dance; for example “to go to a bashment 
dance”. In the Dancehall vernacular, “bashment” is therefore an 
adjective instead of a noun.)

popular love songs, performed by artists such as John Holt &amp; Ken

 came into focus in Jamaica in 1968 as a stage in a continuum of musical
 styles after ska and rock steady. These were the first locally 
originated music forms in post-independence Jamaica. The previously 
distinct colonial-era Jamaican music was known as mento, which evolved 
from the music of 19th century French set dance called quadrille, which 
was popular among the English ruling class in Jamaica. Mento emerged as 
the “fifth figure” of quadrille and has an important connection to 
reggae, specifically the rhythm pattern strummed on the banjo in mento. 
The reintroduction of this rhythmic pattern helped move rocksteady into a
 new identity as reggae. “Reggae” was initially spelled “reggay” when it
 appeared on records. Singer Toots Hibbert (of the Maytals) has 
explained the term reggay was an adaptation of ‘streggay,’ a derogatory 
reference to women. The drummer Leroy Horsemouth Wallace has said the 
term was adapted from musician Alva Reggie Lewis’s style of rhythm 
guitar.

Reggae become distinct for the rhythm guitar pattern described above, 
and the guitar’s close relationship with an organ ‘shuffle’ attributed 
to keyboardist Glen Adams. The drums emphasized beats two and four, as 
had rocksteady.

Reggae became the dominant popular music in Jamaica for the next twenty 
years until the mid-1980s when it evolved rhythmically to the point that
 a newly dominant pattern distinguished it as “dancehall.” An additional
 point of transition from reggae to dancehall was the introduction and 
popularity of computer programmed rhythms, which replaced what had been 
live drums, bass and horns during reggae’s first 16-17 years.

As a marketing term, ‘reggae’ has been used, misleadingly, as a catchall
 for all Jamaican music and other Carribean music.

 music that evolved from ska in late 1966 and had it’s glory until 1968 
when it lay the ground to, and was replaced with, reggae. Even if 
rocksteady is the successor to ska the differences are striking. 
Rocksteady is slower, more refined and cooler. The walking bassline that
 ska inherited from R&amp;B changed and didn’t play on every beat with 
equal emphasis. Instead it played a repeated pattern that syncopated the
 rhythm. Both the bass and the drums plays a prominent role in 
rocksteady and it is sometimes referred to as Jamaican drum and base. 
The style is also known as “rock steady” (instead of rocksteady) which 
also referred to the bass and the drums as a steady rock in the rhythm. 
The vocals are often sweet, soulful and romantic.,

Some of the prominent producers during the short rocksteady era was 
Prince Buster, Clement “Coxsone” Dodd and Duke Reid but the style also 
opened the door to new producers as Joe Gibbs, Bunny Lee and Sonia 
Pottinger

 rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is
 a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music 
underground of the 1980s and became widely popular by the 1990s. The 
“alternative” definition refers to the genre’s distinction from 
mainstream rock music, expressed primarily in a distorted guitar sound, 
subversive and/or transgressive lyrics and generally a nonchalant, 
defiant attitude. The term’s original meaning was broader, referring to a
 generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the 
musical style, or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, 
which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At 
times, “alternative” has been used as a catch-all description for music 
from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or 
for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from 
punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, 
and post-punk).

 Pop was a British movement from early 1990s onwards (a term coined by 
the press and much debated which release spearheaded it; with Suede’s 
debut album or Blur’s Popscene single). It grew out of the indie and 
Madchester scenes of the previous decade and was heavily influenced by 
the British rock bands of the 1960s, in particular The Beatles, The 
Kinks and The Small Faces. It was seen as a backlash against American 
styles, most particularly Grunge. Heavily melodic, with a traditional 
bass / guitar / drums /keyboard lineuup, Oasis and Blur took the style 
around the world with much success. It was, as a style, essentially 
finished by 2000.

 recorded in this era, that does not make them Brit Pop. Use carefully.</span></li></a>

 is a genre of rock music characterized by an emphasis on emotional 
expression, sometimes through confessional lyrics. It emerged as a style
 of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement in 
Washington, D.C., where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore 
and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. In the early
 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by alternative/indie rock and pop
 punk bands such as Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer and Jimmy 
Eat World. By the mid-1990s, emo bands such as Braid, the Promise Ring 
and the Get Up Kids emerged from the burgeoning Midwest emo scene, and 
several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre.

 rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock 
music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre
 that arose in the United States and the UK around the mid-1960s. The 
genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band The Byrds, who began playing
 traditional folk music and Bob Dylan-penned material with rock 
instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by The Beatles and other 
British bands. The term “folk rock” was itself first coined by the U.S. 
music press to describe The Byrds’ music in June 1965, the same month 
that the band’s debut album was issued. The release of The Byrds’ cover 
version of Dylan’s “Mr. Tambourine Man” and its subsequent commercial 
success initiated the folk rock explosion of the mid-1960s. Dylan 
himself was also influential on the genre, particularly his recordings 
with an electric rock band on the Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 
Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde albums. Dylan’s 25 July 1965 appearance 
at the Newport Folk Festival with an electric backing band is also 
considered a pivotal moment in the development of folk rock.

 doom is a style of doom metal that crosses death-doom with funeral

synthesizers are often used to create a “dreamlike” atmosphere. Organs 
are also utilized in keeping with dirge music. Vocals consist of 
mournful chants or growls and are often in the background. </span></li></a>

using guitars distorted through a fuzzbox.

At the time there was no specific label and garage rock was not 
recognized as a separate genre, but critical recognition in the early 
1970s through the release of the the Nuggets compilation albums did much
 to define and memorialize the style. The term derives from the

 rock first appeared in the UK in the late 1970’s, it is generally a 
dark and serious form of rock music, with style elements stemming from 
‘Post Punk’, ‘Post Rock’ and ‘Psychedelic Rock’, later on incorporating 
elements of ‘Synth Wave’, with bands and releases using more electronic 
elements and fusing elements from other styles into the sound. Sometimes
 synonymous with “Death Rock”, “Goth Rock” bands’ sound can vary quite a
 bit from artist to artist, album to album and song to song. Song 
structures, tempos and instrumentation are fairly experimental, and the 
style is mostly cohesive due to it’s themes, aesthetics and lifestyle. 
Themes incorporate a spectrum of issues from political angst to 
alienation in the modern world to romantic tragedy, most of the lyrics 
and vibe tending to be gloomy and depressing (like some might interpret,
 describe or express much of England’s weather). Later becoming in some 
ways more of a counter-culture/underground movement than just a musical 
style by individuals who felt alienated by mainstream society and wished
 to express their rejection of the status quo through music, art and 
fashion. ‘Ethereal’ (sometimes called ‘Ethereal Goth’) is a closely

Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated 
with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with
 alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then 
Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came
 to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and 
underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the 
music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, a number of 
indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions 
about its meaningfulness as a term.

 is a musical genre emerged in the late 1960s, mainly represented by 
groups from West Germany. It is a general term used for bands playing 
experimental, partly electronic type of music. Krautrock is originally a
 subgenre to the progressive rock, but instead of adding components of 
jazz and classical music (as happened in US and UK), the German 
musicians created a more mechanical and electronic sound.

The word “krautrock” was coined by the English music press, and was 
initially insulting as the word kraut was slang for a German person, 
referring to the German dish “sauerkraut”. The negative connotation 
dissappeared as the music made by these bands since then was highly 
appreciated. Today, the word is honoring rather than insulting.

Typical krautrock bands in the early 1970s were Amon Düül II, Tangerine 
Dream, Faust, Can and other bands associated with the Cologne-based 
producer Conny Plank, like Neu!, Kraftwerk and Cluster. The composer 
Karlheinz Stockhausen also had influence on this experimental scene.

 music includes sounds that would normally be considered imperfections

 …).

The standards of lo-fi have evolved throughout the decades and the term

the qualifier may still be applicable.</span></li></a>

 music is a type of easy listening music popular in the 1950s and 1960s.
 It may be meant to evoke in the listeners the feeling of being in a 
place, usually with a tranquil theme, such as a jungle, an island 
paradise or outer space. The range of lounge music encompasses beautiful
 music–influenced instrumentals, modern electronica (with chillout, and 
downtempo influences), while remaining thematically focused on its 
retro-space-age cultural elements. The earliest type of lounge music 
appeared during the 1920s and 1930s, and was known as light music. In 
the 21st century, the term lounge music may also be used to describe the
 types of music played in hotels (the lounge, the bar), casinos, 
supermarkets, several restaurants, and piano bars.

**Retrospective usage**

Exotica, space age pop, and some forms of easy listening music popular 
during the 1950s and 1960s are now broadly termed lounge. The term 
lounge does not appear in textual documentation of the period, such as 
Billboard magazine or long playing album covers, but has been 
retrospectively applied.

While rock and roll was generally influenced by blues and country, 
lounge music was derived from jazz and other musical elements borrowed 
from traditions around the world. Exotica from such artists as Les 
Baxter, Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman sold millions of records during 
its heyday. It combined music that was popular outside the USA, such as 
various Latin genres (e.g., Bossa nova, Cha-Cha-Cha, Mambo as in Cal 
Tjader’s fine Latin jazz efforts), Polynesian, French, etc. into a 
relaxed, palatable sound. Such music could have some instruments 
exaggerated (e.g., a Polynesian song might have an exotic percussion 
arrangement using bongos, and vocalists imitating wild animals). Many of
 these recordings were portrayed as originating in exotic foreign lands,
 but in truth were recorded in Hollywood recording studios by veteran 
session musicians. Another genre, space age pop, mimicked space age 
sound effects of the time and reflected the public interest in space 
exploration. With the advent of stereophonic technology, artists such as
 Esquivel used spatial audio techniques to full effect, creating 
whooshing sounds with his orchestra.

Allmusic describes lounge as less “adventurous” than exotica or space 
age pop, but not as “watered-down” as Muzak. “Instead, it occupied the 
middle ground, appealing to fans of traditional pop as well as space age
 pop.”

A good deal of lounge music was pure instrumental (i.e., no main vocal 
part, although there could be minor vocal parts). Sometimes, this music 
would be theme music from movies or TV shows, although such music could 
be produced independently from other entertainment productions. These 
instrumentals could be produced with an orchestral arrangement, or from 
an arrangement of instruments very similar to that found in jazz, or 
even rock and roll such as the Hammond Organ or electric guitar.

**Lounge singers**

“Swinging” music of the era is also considered “lounge” and consisted of
 a schmaltzy continuation of the swing jazz era of the 1930s and 1940s, 
but with more of an emphasis on the vocalist. The legendary Rat Pack of 
Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., along with similar 
artists such as Bobby Darin, Jackie Gleason, Wayne Newton, Louis Prima, 
Sonny King, and Sam Butera are notable examples. The music of Burt 
Bacharach was soon featured as part of many lounge singers’ repertoires.
 Such artists performed mainly at featured lounges in Las Vegas casinos.
 Documented pioneers of the Las Vegas lounge scene, the Mary Kaye Trio 
were first on the scene in the early 50’s.

Lounge singers have a lengthy history stretching back to the decades of 
the early twentieth century. The somewhat derisive term lounge lizard 
was coined then, and less well known lounge singers have often been 
ridiculed as dinosaurs of past eras and parodied for their smarmy 
delivery of standards. In any event, these lounge singers, perhaps 
performing in a hotel or cocktail bar, are usually accompanied by one or
 two other musicians, and they favor cover songs composed by others, 
especially pop standards, many deriving from the days of Tin Pan Alley.

Many well-known performers got their start as lounge singers and 
musicians. Although he claims not to have worked for very long, Billy 
Joel worked as a lounge musician and penned the song “Piano Man” about 
his experience. Not all lounge singers, however, sing lounge music.

**Resurgence**

Lounge emerged in the late 1980s as a label of endearment by younger 
fans whose parents had listened to such music in the 1960s. It has 
enjoyed resurgences in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, led initially 
by iconic figures such as Buster Poindexter and Jaymz Bee. In Japan, 
producer Yasuharu Konishi became popular for his work with Pizzicato 
Five, and is often considered “the Godfather of Shibuya-kei,” a genre 
mostly derived from 1960s lounge music.

In the early 1990s the lounge revival was in full swing and included 
such groups as Combustible Edison, Love Jones, The Cocktails, Pink 
Martini, the High Llamas, Don Tiki, and Nightcaps. Alternative band 
Stereolab demonstrated the influence of lounge with releases like their 
1993 EP Space Age Bachelor Pad Music and their 1997 album Dots and 
Loops, and in 1996 Capitol Records began issuing the Ultra-Lounge series
 of lounge music albums. The lounge style was starkly in contrast to the
 grunge music that dominated the period. These groups wore suits and 
played music inspired by earlier works of Antônio Carlos Jobim, Juan 
García Esquivel, Louis Prima and many others.

In the 2000s Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine has added to 
this resurgence by covering (usually profane) hit songs of other genres 
(primarily metal and hip hop) in the style of a lounge singer. In 2004, 
the Parisian band, Nouvelle Vague, released a self-titled album in which
 they covered songs from the ’80s post-punk and new wave genres in the 
style of Bossa Nova. Other artists have taken lounge music to new 
heights by recombining rock with pop, such as Jon Brion, The Bird and 
the Bee, Triangle Sun, Pink Martini, the Buddha-Lounge series, and the 
surrounding regulars of Café Largo. The movie The Rise and Fall of Black
 Velvet Flag (2003) is a documentary about three older punk rockers who 
created a lounge-punk band.

**In film**

In the 1980 movie The Blues Brothers, most of the members of the band 
were reduced to performing as “Murph and the Magictones” (headlining at a
 Holiday Inn) after bandleader Jake Blues went to prison. When the band 
takes a break to speak with Jake and his brother Elwood, Murph switches 
on a Muzak version of “Just the Way You Are,” performed by Billy Joel, a
 former lounge musician himself. Later, when Jake and Elwood are in an 
elevator, Jobim’s “The Girl from Ipanema” is heard on Muzak.

The 1989 film The Fabulous Baker Boys starred Jeff Bridges, Beau 
Bridges, and Michelle Pfeiffer as a successful lounge act.

The film Swingers was set during the mid-1990s lounge and swing revival 
in Los Angeles, and featured legendary performers like Dean Martin, 
Louis Jordan and Tony Bennett, as well as modern lounge acts like Love 
Jones, Joey Altruda and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

The soundtrack of the 1994 anthology film Four Rooms consists of lounge 
music.

**Comedy**

Andy Kaufman created a character called Tony Clifton. A parody of show 
biz entitlement and excess, Clifton is untalented, lazy (often not 
bothering to remember the words to the songs), and abusive to his 
audiences. Bill Murray also portrayed a particularly bad lounge singer 
on Saturday Night Live, Nick The Lounge Singer, best known for providing
 his own lyrics to the John Williams theme from Star Wars and performing
 an over-the-top version of the Morris Albert hit “Feelings”. Later, 
Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer portrayed a goofy married duo of 
lounge-style musicians, but in unlikely venues such as high school 
dances. Part of the humor derived from the incongruous application of 
their “nerdy” and outdated style to performances of current pop-music 
hits. British comedians Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones appeared as a 
cheesy keyboard and bass duo during the end credits of one series of 
their long-running sketch show. Richard Cheese and The Lounge Kittens 
specialize in playing lounge-style arrangements of recent popular rock, 
metal and hip hop songs, sung in a croony traditional swing vocal style,
 contrasting an elegant jazz treatment of the music with often profane 
and ribald lyrics to create a humorous dissonance.</span></li></a>

 rock is a rhythmically complex, often guitar-based, style of 
experimental rock and indie rock music that emerged in the late 1980s, 
influenced by progressive rock bands like King Crimson and 20th century 
minimalist composers such as Steve Reich. It is characterized by 
complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and 
starting), counterpoint, odd time signatures, angular melodies, and 
extended, often dissonant, chords.</span></li></a>

 wave is a genre of rock music and a term which became popular in the 
late 1970s and the early 80s with connections to punk rock, disco, and 
electronic music. New wave was a cultural shift away from the blues, 
classic rock, and progressive rock sounds which were dominant in the 
early and mid 70s. The term refers to both this shift and the great 
amount of cross pollination happening in music in the late 70s when 
non-mainstream musicians began incorporating a wide range of seemingly 
disparate sounds with a DIY rawness. Early punk, dub reggae, funk, art 
rock, glam pop, kraut rock, and experimental electronic music were all 
very influential on this new wave of rock musicians. For a very short 
period in the 70s the term was interchangable with Punk, especially in 
the US where the industry was wary of the “punk fad”. There were also 
different usages in the UK and the US mainstream media. Some music 
journalists consider New Wave to be a genre that takes the energy and 
ethos of Punk and combines it with more sonic and structural 
experimentation. Still, many consider New Wave to be such a broad 
umbrella term that it loses any defining power, similar to Alternative 
Rock which came later. As a result many artists and fans use related 
subgenres like Synth-Pop, Post-Punk, Goth-Rock, New Romantic, and Dark 
Wave to point to more specific qualities embodied in the diverse New 
Wave sound. By the mid 80s the term was less frequently used by both the
 music industry and journalists, but in the late 1990s and into the 21st
 century a resurgence and nostalgia for popular 80s music has brought 
the term back into popular usage. </span></li></a>

 is a derivation of Grindcore/Hardcore Punk. Has been use as a term 
since mid/late 80’s and stabilized itself as a own genre.

The songs are usually chaotic short blasts of noise, accompanied by 
screamed, growled, or shouted vocals. While there is some instrumental 
variation (some groups use drum machines, others use completely 
non-musical noise sources), Noisecore acts tend to use a guitar and/or 
bass guitar.

Earlier releases tagged as “Noisecore” tend to be a raw, chaotic, and 
lo-fi form of Hardcore; artists in this style include Tranquilizer (2), 
Kuolema, and Brigada Do Ódio.
Napalm Death’s “You Suffer” is generally considered the blueprint for 
most later Noisecore, being approximately one second long. Tracks can go
 to even couple dozen of seconds, but hardly ever reaches length of 1 
minute or so.
Typical Noisecore releases (whether singles or LPs) can contain forty or
 more songs, with some releases claiming to contain thousands of tracks.

Lyrical content varies from highly political (Seven Minutes Of Nausea, 
Fear Of God) to the gross/offensive (later Anal Cunt, Gore Beyond 
Necropsy) to the absurd/surreal (Sore Throat, Minch); some acts (early 
Anal Cunt, Genital Masticator, The Gerogerigege) use wordless vocal 
sounds.</span></li></a>

 (originally called new musick) is a broad type of rock music that 
emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed 
from the simplicity and traditionalism of punk rock to adopt a variety 
of avant-garde sensibilities. Inspired by punk’s energy and DIY ethic 
but determined to break from rock cliches, artists experimented 
diversely with sources including electronic music and black styles like 
funk, disco, dub, and free jazz; novel recording and production 
techniques; and ideas from art and politics, including critical theory, 
modernist art and literature. Communities that produced independent 
record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines 
developed around these pioneering musical scenes, which coalesced in 
cities such as London, New York, Manchester, and San Francisco.

The early post-punk vanguard was represented by groups such as Siouxsie 
and the Banshees, Wire, Public Image Ltd, the Pop Group, Cabaret 
Voltaire, Magazine, Pere Ubu, Gang of Four, Joy Division, Talking Heads,
 Throbbing Gristle, the Slits, the Cure, the Fall and Au Pairs. The 
movement was closely related to the development of ancillary genres such
 as gothic rock, neo-psychedelia, no wave and industrial music. By the 
mid 1980s, post-punk had dissipated while providing the impetus for the 
New Pop movement as well much subsequent alternative and independent 
music.</span></li></a>

 metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of 
traditional heavy metal with speed metal, often within symphonic 
context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, 
and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance 
prevalent for example in extreme metal. Power metal bands usually have 
anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses,
 thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally “powerful” sound.

The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two 
different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced 
in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later
 more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially 
Scandinavia, Germany, Greece, Spain and Italy), South America 
(especially Brazil and Argentina) and East Asia with a lighter, more 
melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. </span></li></a>

The term is common for the music of the British 1979 Mod revival (Secret

well be “Time for Action” by Secret Affair (see Youtube link)

U.S.-American The Knack, who where similarily 1960s-influenced (but

 rock is a rock music genre that was developed in the early to mid-1970s
 in the U.K. A back-to-basics movement which incorporated roots rock, 
pub rock was a reaction against expensively-recorded and produced 
progressive rock and flashy glam rock. Although short-lived, pub rock 
was notable for returning live rock to the small intimate venues (pubs 
and clubs) of its early years. With pub rock’s emphasis on small venues,
 simple, fairly inexpensive recordings and indie record labels, it was 
the catalyst for the development of the British punk rock scene. By 
1975, the standard for mainstream rock album recordings was expensive, 
lengthy studio recording processes overseen by highly-paid record 
producers, with the goal of creating highly polished end products, with 
overdubs, double-tracking and studio effects. Some mainstream bands 
spent months in the studio perfecting their recording, to achieve a 
meticulously crafted and perfect product. Pub rockers rejected this type
 of costly, complex recording process; instead, with pub rockers, the 
goal was simply to capture the band’s “live” sound and feel in the 
studio.

Australian Pub Rock is similar, hard rock, blues rock, and/or 
progressive rock. It waspopular throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and 
still influencing contemporary Australian music in the 2000s. The term 
came from the venues where most of these bands originally played — 
inner-city and suburban pubs. These often noisy, hot, small and crowded 
venues were not always ideal as music venues and favoured loud, simple 
songs based on drums and electric guitar riffs.Though Australia has a 
relatively small population, the proportionally high number of venues 
that bands could play in, meant that a band could tour extensively, 
often playing every night for long periods. This would allow bands such 
as AC/DC, Cold Chisel, INXS, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo and others to 
take their live skills into large venues in the US and Europe with ease.</span></li></a>

 be recorded and used as part of the soundtrack, which also includes 
dialogue and/or sound effects. Alternatively, the written score may be 
re-recorded for release to the public, so that the released recording is
 separate from the soundtrack.
For example, John Williams’s Star Wars is a score used as a film 
soundtrack. Franz Waxman’s The Bride Of Frankenstein is a newly recorded
 version of the original score, and is not a film soundtrack. Cecil
